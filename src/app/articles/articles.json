      "contents": "<h2><strong>Struggling With CARS? You're Not Alone.</strong></h2>\n<p>For a lot of premeds, <strong>CARS feels like the most frustrating part</strong> of the MCAT. It’s not about content you can memorize. You can’t Anki your way through it. And every time you feel like you’ve figured it out, the next passage pulls the rug out from under you.</p>\n<p>If that’s you, take a breath. You’re not the problem—your <strong>approach</strong> is. After tutoring dozens of students across San Diego and beyond at WozPrep, I’ve noticed <strong>3 big mistakes</strong> students make when it comes to CARS. Let's walk through them—and how you can start thinking differently.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>1. Stop Looking for a “Strategy”</strong></h3>\n<p>I get questions like these all the time: <i>Should I read the questions first?</i> ... <i>Highlight every transition word?</i> ... <i>Read the last sentence of every paragraph?</i> ... <i> Highlight three words per line?</i> No. Just... no. Let’s get this out of the way: <strong>there is no magic strategy for CARS.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me ask you something—when you read your favorite book, are you using a <i>strategy</i>? When you read the news, are you <i>strategizing</i>? What <i>skill</i> are you using when you’re reading this very article?</p>\n<p>Exactly. You’re just <strong>reading to understand</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is the core of CARS. The test isn't asking you to find tricks. It's asking you to <i>connect</i> with the author. That’s the real skill being tested: <strong>Can you understand what another person is saying, and why they’re saying it?</strong></p>\n<p>So here’s what you should do instead:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Start by <strong>reading the passage in full</strong>. Don’t jump to the questions. Don’t skim.</li>\n  <li>As you read, <strong>imagine you’re the author</strong>. Why would <strong>you</strong> write this?</li>\n  <li>Ask yourself: <strong>What’s the main idea?</strong> Why would someone write this? What is the author trying to <i>convince</i> us of?</li>\n  <li>Then ask: <strong>What’s their tone?</strong> Why would someone write this the way they wrote this? How do they feel about it? Are they annoyed, excited, reflective? (I often recommend students rate tone on a -3 to +3 scale: -3 is strongly negative, +3 is strongly positive.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you’ve nailed the main idea and tone, you’re already halfway done with the questions. Highlighting can be helpful—sure. Names, contrasting ideas, terms. But that’s <i>not</i> the point. Forget tricks. Forget rules. <strong>The point is understanding.</strong></p>\n\n<h3><strong>2. Stop Cherry-Picking Quotes</strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s the next big mistake: You get to the questions and... suddenly you’re <strong>going back to the passage constantly</strong>, skimming like a detective looking for that “one line” that supports an answer.</p>\n<p>This is one of the biggest traps I see. Yes, sometimes you need to revisit the passage—especially when the question is about a specific term or detail. But if you’ve read carefully and understood the main idea and tone, <strong>most questions can be answered without rereading</strong>. I tell my students this all the time:</p>\n<blockquote>The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</blockquote>\n<p>That’s Aristotle, not me. But it perfectly captures this problem and the solution. In CARS, you’re not building an answer from a few handpicked lines. You can’t piece together understanding from fragments. You need to build the understanding up front—during your first read—then apply it to the questions.</p>\n<p>So, yes—go back when needed. But trust your read. If your understanding of the main idea and tone is solid, you’ll rarely need to dig through paragraphs again.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>3. You're Not Learning From Your Mistakes</strong></h3>\n<p>This one is tough. But if you want to improve, you have to <strong>analyze your performance</strong>.</p>\n<p>Too many students do CARS passages without reflecting. They finish, check answers, shrug, and move on. But if you want to <i>actually get better</i>, you have to look in the mirror.</p>\n<p>I encourage my students to use a method inspired by the <a href='https://www.jesuits.org/spirituality/the-ignatian-examen/' target='_blank'><strong>Ignatian Examen</strong></a>: After each CARS passage (or section), write down:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>3 things that went well</li>\n  <li>3 things that didn’t go well</li>\n  <li>3 things you’ll do differently next time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do this consistently, and you’ll stop running on autopilot. You’ll start <em>noticing</em> patterns. You’ll realize what works for <strong>you</strong>, and slowly, you’ll develop your own personal approach. And that’s the only strategy that really matters—<strong>the one that works for you</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Putting It All Together: A General Framework</strong></h3>\n<p>So here’s how I want you to approach your next CARS passage:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Read the passage</strong>. No tricks. Don’t skim. Don’t rush to the questions.</li>\n  <li><strong>Understand the main idea and tone</strong>. Imagine you’re the author. What are you trying to say, and how do you feel about it?</li>\n  <li><strong>Go to the questions</strong>. Try to answer based on your understanding. Trust yourself. Don’t reread unless absolutely necessary.</li>\n  <li><strong>Reflect</strong>. Write down what went well, what didn’t, and what you’ll try next time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sure, you can try specific tools along the way—writing paragraph summaries, finding “sub-main ideas,” picking the paragraph that best captures the main point. But don’t force a strategy that doesn’t fit. Focus on what actually helps <strong>you</strong> understand better.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>There Is No One-Size-Fits-All Method for CARS</strong></h3>\n<p>The entire reason I started <strong>WozPrep</strong> was to challenge the idea that test prep has to be impersonal and overpriced. I believe everyone learns differently, and that’s why my tutoring is built around <i>you</i>—not some magic formula.</p>\n<p> The CARS section is the perfect example of why this matters. It’s about learning how <i>you</i> think, how <i>you</i> read, and how to build the habits that help <i>you</i> understand tone and main idea more clearly.</p>\n<p>If you’re tired of generic advice and want <strong>1-on-1 support tailored to how you think</strong>, <a href='/mcat'><strong>click here to learn more about MCAT tutoring at WozPrep</strong></a></p>",

      "contents": "<p>One of the smartest moves you can make in your MCAT prep is to <strong>leverage your mistakes</strong>—not just review them. If you’re doing practice problems but not capturing your weak spots in a system like Anki, you’re losing half the value of those questions. Let’s fix that.</p> \n\n<a href='/articles/how-to-use-anki'><strong>Learn More About How to Use Anki to Study For the MCAT here</strong></a>\n\n<h3 id='when-to-make-cards'>When Should You Make Your Own Anki Cards?</h3>\n<p>Most students think Anki is just for memorizing content—and yes, it's great for that. But where Anki really shines is in <strong>locking in insights</strong> from practice questions. When you get something wrong and actually take the time to reflect, process, and encode that learning into a flashcard, you're building long-term mastery.</p>\n\n <p><strong>The golden rule:</strong> <em>Create a card every time you realize you don’t understand something during practice.</em></p>\n\n<p>Don’t just copy the question and walk away. That might feel productive, but it’s not going to help you in the long run. Instead, you need to figure out <strong>why</strong> you got the question wrong. What was the exact piece of knowledge—or misunderstanding—that tripped you up? That’s the insight you want to capture in a card.</p>\n\n<p>If your Anki cards are just screenshots of UWorld questions, you’re missing the point. Make your cards <strong>teach you</strong> what you didn’t know. Focus on reasoning, not rote repetition.</p>\n\n<h3 id='how-to-make-cards'>How to Make Effective Cards: Step-by-Step</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Review your incorrect answer</strong> and read the explanation carefully.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> What is the core concept I misunderstood or didn’t know?</li>\n  <li><strong>Phrase that concept as a flashcard.</strong> Make it general enough to help on future questions, not just that one.</li>\n  <li><strong>Use simple language</strong> and include logic, diagrams, or contrast items where helpful.</li>\n  <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Make multiple cards if the question revealed more than one weakness.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id='example-breakdown'>Example Breakdown: V<sub>max</sub> and Enzyme Kinetics</h3>\n\n<p>Let’s walk through a sample question and how to turn your mistake into a solid Anki card:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p> <a href='/mcat/practice'><strong>From our MCAT Practice Library</strong></a> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which of the following is most likely to increase the V<sub>max</sub> of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Choices:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>A.</strong> Adding a competitive inhibitor</li>\n  <li><strong>B.</strong> Increasing substrate concentration ❌ </li>\n  <li><strong>C.</strong> Adding more enzyme ✅</li>\n  <li><strong>D.</strong> Decreasing pH</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><i>Let’s say you picked B. That’s a super common trap answer.</i></p>\n\n<h3>What Went Wrong?</h3>\n<p>If you chose B, you probably misunderstood what V<sub>max</sub> really means. You may know it’s the “maximum rate” but didn’t realize <strong>you can only change it by changing the amount of enzyme present</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>Cards you Could Make:</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Card 1 (Conceptual Understanding):</strong><br />\n  <em>Front:</em> What does V<sub>max</sub> represent in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction?<br />\n  <em>Back:</em> V<sub>max</sub> is the maximum reaction rate when the enzyme is saturated with substrate. It is represented by: V<sub>max</sub> = k<sub>cat</sub> [E]</li>\n  \n  <li><strong>Card 2 (Clarification of Effect):</strong><br />\n  <em>Front:</em>Enzyme concentration effect on V<sub>max</sub><br />\n  <em>Back:</em> V<sub>max</sub> increases proportionally to the concentration of enzyme according to V<sub>max</sub> = k<sub>cat</sub> [E]</li>\n  \n  <li><strong>Card 3 (Clarification of Non-effect):</strong><br />\n  <em>Front:</em> How does increasing substrate concentration affect V<sub>max</sub>?<br />\n  <em>Back:</em> <strong>It doesn’t!</strong> Once the enzyme is saturated, adding more substrate has no effect—V<sub>max</sub> is already reached. Only adding more enzyme can increase it according to V<sub>max</sub> = k<sub>cat</sub> [E]</li>\n </ul>\n\n<p>You could link to this <a href='https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/biomolecules/enzyme-kinetics/v/steady-states-and-the-michaelis-menten-equation ' target='_blank'>Khan Academy explanation</a> in the “Extra” field if you want a reference.</p>\n\n<h3 id='summary'>Quick Recap</h3>\n<p>Here’s the streamlined version of how to turn a practice question into a killer Anki card:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Find your error.</li>\n  <li>Reflect on what you didn’t understand.</li>\n  <li>Create a flashcard that fixes that gap in your knowledge.</li>\n  <li>Keep it general, clear, and reusable for future questions.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id='wozprep-connection'>WozPrep: Personalized MCAT Prep That Actually Works</h3>\n<p>At <strong>WozPrep</strong>, we believe test prep should be as unique as the student.

      "contents": "<p>Let's face it - preparing for the MCAT is a marathon, not a sprint. And just like any marathon, having the right equipment makes all the difference between crossing that finish line triumphantly or stumbling halfway through. I've seen countless pre-med students waste precious study time (and money) on subpar practice materials, only to be shocked when their actual MCAT score doesn't reflect their practice results.</p>\n\n<p>After helping hundreds of students through WozPrep boost their MCAT scores, I've developed a no-nonsense approach to selecting practice materials that <strong>actually work</strong>. So let's cut through the marketing fluff and get straight to what you need to succeed.</p>\n\n<h2>Start With a Solid Diagnostic</h2>\n\n<p>Before diving into full-on MCAT studying, you absolutely need to know where you stand. Take Blueprint's free half-length exam as a diagnostic - this will give you a clear picture of your baseline and highlight which areas need the most attention.</p>\n\n<p>The diagnostic isn't about getting a perfect score; it's about identifying your weaknesses so you can strategically allocate your study time. Once you've pinpointed your problem areas, you can transition to content review (check out our <a href='/articles/content-review'>detailed guide</a> for more on this phase).</p>\n\n<h2>AAMC Materials: Non-Negotiable Resources</h2>\n\n<p>You <strong>ABSOLUTELY MUST</strong> purchase the <a href='https://store.aamc.org/online-only-official-mcat-prep-bundle.html' target='_blank'><strong>AAMC online bundle</strong></a>. These materials are created by the same people who write the actual MCAT, making them the most representative practice you can get.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the $310 price tag might seem steep, but this is your medical career we're talking about. If you need to pick up extra shifts at work to afford this bundle, do it. Your future self will thank you. For those genuinely unable to afford these materials, AAMC does offer a fee assistance program that provides these resources for free, along with discounted MCAT registration fees. You can learn more about this program <a href='https://students-residents.aamc.org/fee-assistance-program/what-are-benefits-fee-assistance-program'>here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Full-Length Practice Tests</h3>\n\n<p>The Online-Only MCAT Official Prep Bundle includes these critical full-length practice exams:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep Practice Exam 1</li>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep Practice Exam 2</li>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep Practice Exam 3</li>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep Practice Exam 4</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Plus these additional resources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep Free Practice Exam (Scored)</li>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep Free Sample Test (Unscored)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>When to Take AAMC Practice Exams</h4>\n\n<p>For most students, I recommend scheduling one full-length exam per week during the six weeks leading up to test day. For example, if your MCAT is scheduled for May 10, you might take practice exams on May 3, April 26, April 19, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Dedicate an entire day to taking the exam and the following day to reviewing it thoroughly. With your first couple of practice tests, you might need more than one day for review as you identify content gaps and create Anki cards (see our <a href='/articles/how-to-use-anki'>guide on effective Anki use</a>). As you progress through your prep, review time typically decreases as your knowledge base grows and your review process becomes more efficient.</p>\n\n<h4>Simulating Test Day Conditions: This Is Non-Negotiable</h4>\n\n<p>When taking practice exams, you <i>must</i> simulate actual test day conditions. I cannot stress how important this is! Psychology teaches us about content-dependent effects - your performance is tied to the environment in which you learn and practice.</p>\n\n<p>This means:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wake up at the same time you will on test day (usually around 6 AM)</li>\n<li>Drive to a location that <strong>IS NOT YOUR HOME</strong> (a local library works perfectly)</li>\n<li>Begin your exam promptly at 8 AM</li>\n<li>Sit through the entire 7.5-hour experience with only the designated breaks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I learned this the hard way. When I took my first two practice exams starting at noon, and then switched to 8 AM starts, my score dropped by 5 points. I've seen similar patterns with countless WozPrep students. Don't make this mistake!</p>\n\n<p>Other critical test-day simulation tips:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Leave your phone in the car - no distractions</li>\n<li>Pack and eat lunch exactly as you plan to on test day</li>\n<li>Take breaks that match the actual MCAT timing</li>\n<li>Don't skip breakfast - fuel your brain properly</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Practice Questions: Quality Over Quantity</h3>\n\n<p>For all practice questions, timing is crucial. Always set a timer and hold yourself to the allotted time limits - generally 10 minutes per CARS passage, 8 minutes for other passages, and 4 minutes for discrete questions. For a deeper dive into section timing, check out <a href='/articles/mcat-timing'>our article on MCAT timing</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DO NOT IGNORE THIS ADVICE.</strong> Working under realistic time constraints is essential for MCAT success.</p>\n\n<h4>CARS Practice Materials</h4>\n\n<p>The AAMC bundle includes these Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills resources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep CARS Diagnostic Tool</li>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills Question Pack, Volume 1</li>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills Question Pack, Volume 2</li>\n<li>Online Practice Questions from The Official Guide to the MCAT Exam</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You <i>absolutely must</i> complete all of these CARS questions if you want to succeed on this challenging section, especially if you're starting with a low baseline score or if English isn't your first language.</p>\n\n<p>I've seen too many students postpone CARS practice until the last minute, thinking they can cram it in. This is a huge mistake! CARS improvement doesn't come from flashcards or content review - it requires consistent practice over time to develop the necessary critical thinking and analytical reading skills.</p>\n\n<h4>Other Essential Practice Questions</h4>\n\n<p>While the AAMC bundle includes numerous question packs, if you need to prioritize, focus on the Section Banks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep Section Bank, Volume 1</li>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep Section Bank, Volume 2</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These section banks contain the most challenging and representative questions outside of the full-length exams. They're invaluable for developing the advanced reasoning skills needed for the actual MCAT.</p>\n\n<p>The remaining AAMC question packs include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep Biology Question Pack, Volume 1</li>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep Biology Question Pack, Volume 2</li>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep Chemistry Question Pack</li>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep Physics Question Pack</li>\n<li>MCAT Official Prep Independent Question Bank</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ideally, you should complete all of these. However, if time is limited, focus on question packs that address your weakest subjects. Struggling with chemistry? Prioritize the Chemistry Question Pack.</p>\n\n<h2>Supplemental Practice Materials</h2>\n\n<h3>UWorld</h3>\n\n<p>If you feel the AAMC materials aren't sufficient, you might consider UWorld's question bank (<a href='https://gradschool.uworld.com/mcat/question-bank/'>available here</a>). Many consider UWorld to be was the second-best resource after AAMC, particularly for B/B, C/P, and P/S sections.</p>\n\n<p>While their explanations are detailed, the questions often don't mirror the AAMC's style as closely as they claim. I recommend reviewing every problem explanation, regardless of whether you answered correctly. Creating Anki cards for concepts you missed - not just specific questions - can help solidify your understanding.</p>\n\n<p>UWorld is generally more difficult than actual AAMC material, which can be both a benefit and a drawback. Master UWorld, and AAMC questions may seem easier, but don't be discouraged if your UWorld scores aren't where you want them to be.</p>\n\n<h3>Blueprint</h3>\n\n<p>Blueprint offers one free full-length exam that you should consider taking before starting your six weeks of AAMC practice tests. You can access this free resource <a href='https://blueprintprep.com/mcat/free-resources/free-mcat-practice-bundle' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>They also sell additional practice exams, but many students do not need more than the 6 AAMC exams and 1 free Blueprint exam. If you've exhausted other options and desperately need more practice, you can purchase their exams <a href='https://blueprintprep.com/mcat/practice-exams' target='_blank'>here</a>, but I'd recommend them as a last resort.</p>\n\n<h3>WozPrep: Free, High-Quality Practice That Mirrors the Real MCAT</h3>\n\n<p>Unlike the expensive options mentioned above, WozPrep offers an extensive library of <strong>FREE</strong> practice questions that closely mirror the actual MCAT's style and difficulty. Our CARS practice collection is particularly comprehensive, containing passages that target the exact reasoning skills tested by the AAMC.</p>\n\n<p>What sets WozPrep materials apart is our commitment to teaching the underlying thought process rather than just providing answers. Each question comes with detailed explanations that walk you through the logic needed to arrive at the correct answer - developing the critical thinking skills that commercial prep companies often neglect.</p>\n\n<p>The best part? You don't need to choose between quality and affordability. Access <a href='/mcat/practice'><strong>our complete question library</strong></a> and see the difference for yourself.</p>\n\n<h2>Making Anki Cards From Practice Questions</h2>\n\n<p>Doing practice questions without capturing what you learn is like leaving money on the table. One of the most powerful techniques I've seen boost MCAT scores is turning practice questions into targeted Anki cards.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the truth: <strong>simply reviewing questions isn't enough</strong>. When you get a question wrong (or right for the wrong reasons), you need a system to ensure you never make that mistake again. This is where creating custom Anki cards becomes your secret weapon.</p>\n\n<p>The real value comes from identifying <strong>exactly</strong> what concept tripped you up and creating a card that specifically addresses that knowledge gap. Don't just screenshot the question - extract the underlying principle that will help you with similar questions in the future.</p>\n\n<p>I've developed a comprehensive guide on how to transform practice questions into high-yield Anki cards that actually stick. Check out the complete methodology at <a href='/articles/practice-question-to-anki-card'><strong>How to Turn MCAT Practice Questions into Powerful Anki Cards</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>The quality of your practice materials directly impacts your MCAT performance. AAMC resources are an absolute must for anyone studying for the MCAT, but supplementing with other practice questions, whether from WozPrep, UWorld, or Blueprint, can give you the extra edge you might need on test day.</p>\n\n<p>Remember - timed practice under test-day conditions, along with using Anki so you never make the same mistake twice, is the key to converting your hard work into the score you deserve. <strong>Don't just study hard; study smart.</strong></p>",

      "contents": "<p><strong>Time management can make or break your MCAT score.</strong> You could know every amino acid and every psych term cold—but if you can't finish the exam, none of that matters. One of the biggest hurdles for students isn't content—it's <strong>timing</strong>. So let's break it down. Below is a detailed minute-by-minute MCAT timing strategy designed to help you stay on pace in all four sections of the exam.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Why Timing Matters</strong></h2>\n<p>The MCAT is a <strong>grueling 7.5-hour exam</strong>. Pacing yourself isn’t just about finishing on time—it’s about <i>keeping your brain from frying halfway through.</i> If you spend too long on a passage early on, you’ll feel the stress snowball later. That’s why WozPrep teaches every student to stick to a <strong>strict but doable timing schedule</strong>—so when you practice, you’re not just doing questions. You’re simulating the real thing.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Timing for Science Sections: C/P, B/B, P/S</strong></h2>\n<p>Each of these science-heavy sections gives you <strong>95 minutes to answer 59 questions</strong>, spread across <strong>10 passages and 15 discrete questions</strong>. Here’s our breakdown:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Passage 1 – 8 mins</strong> (1:35 → 1:27)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 2 – 8 mins</strong> (1:27 → 1:19)</li>\n  <li><strong>Discrete 1 – 4 mins</strong> (1:19 → 1:15)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 3 – 8 mins</strong> (1:15 → 1:07)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 4 – 8 mins</strong> (1:07 → 0:59)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 5 – 8 mins</strong> (0:59 → 0:51)</li>\n  <li><strong>Discrete 2 – 4 mins</strong> (0:51 → 0:47)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 6 – 8 mins</strong> (0:47 → 0:39)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 7 – 8 mins</strong> (0:39 → 0:31)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 8 – 8 mins</strong> (0:31 → 0:23)</li>\n  <li><strong>Discrete 3 – 4 mins</strong> (0:23 → 0:19)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 9 – 8 mins</strong> (0:19 → 0:11)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 10 – 8 mins</strong> (0:11 → 0:03)</li>\n  <li><strong>Discrete 4 – 3 mins</strong> (0:03 → 0:00)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><i>Stick to this breakdown religiously during full-length practice exams.</i> The goal isn’t perfection—it’s learning how long you spend reading vs answering and knowing when to move on.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Timing for CARS: The Real Mental Marathon</strong></h2>\n<p>CARS is 90 minutes long and contains 53 questions across 9 passages. It’s the <strong>highest-pressure section for timing</strong> because there are no discrete questions—just passage after passage. Many students make the mistake of overanalyzing early passages, then rushing through the rest. Here's the fix:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Passage 1 – 10 mins</strong> (1:30 → 1:20)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 2 – 10 mins</strong> (1:20 → 1:10)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 3 – 10 mins</strong> (1:10 → 1:00)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 4 – 10 mins</strong> (1:00 → 0:50)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 5 – 10 mins</strong> (0:50 → 0:40)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 6 – 10 mins</strong> (0:40 → 0:30)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 7 – 10 mins</strong> (0:30 → 0:20)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 8 – 10 mins</strong> (0:20 → 0:10)</li>\n  <li><strong>Passage 9 – 10 mins</strong> (0:10 → 0:00)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don’t spend more than 4 minutes reading the passage. Focus on main idea, tone, and argument structure. Then dive into the questions with purpose.</p><p>For more information on CARS, check out <a href='how-to-actually-get-better-at-cars'><strong>our guide on how to get better at CARS.</strong></a></p>\n\n<h2><strong>How to Apply These Timing Strategies</strong></h2>\n<p><i>These numbers mean nothing if you’re not applying them under test conditions.</i> That’s why it’s so important to practice with full-length exams and high-quality question banks that simulate real MCAT pressure.</p>\n\n<p>Not sure where to start? We’ve got you covered. Check out our companion article on the <a href='/articles/practice-materials'><strong>best MCAT practice materials</strong></a> to use these timing strategies effectively. Whether you’re using AAMC, UWorld, or third-party tests, the goal is the same: <strong>practice like it’s real so you’re ready when it is.</strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>WozPrep’s Takeaway</strong></h2>\n<p>At WozPrep, we don’t just help you memorize. We help you <i>strategize</i>. Timing is a skill—and just like every other MCAT skill, it can be trained. Use this breakdown, stick to it, and watch your score—and confidence—skyrocket.</p>\n",

      "contents": "<h2><strong>Using Anki for the MCAT? Here's How to Actually Do It Right.</strong></h2>\n<p>Let me be blunt: if you’re not using <strong>Anki</strong> for the MCAT, you’re leaving points on the table. Anki is one of the most powerful tools for long-term retention on the MCAT. If you don’t really know what Anki is—don’t worry. You’re not alone. This guide breaks down how to set it up, when to use pre-made decks (and when not to), and how to make your own cards in a way that will actually boost your score.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Table of Contents</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"#setting-up-anki\">Setting Up Anki</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#premade-decks\">Should I Use Pre-Made Decks?</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#your-own-deck\">Making Your Own Anki Deck</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"setting-up-anki\"><strong>Setting Up Anki</strong></h2>\n<p>First, download Anki from <a href='https://apps.ankiweb.net/' target='_blank'>ankiweb.net</a>. Once it's installed, <strong>create a free account</strong>. This lets you sync your decks between your computer, your phone, and the web app—so you can study anywhere, even in line at Trader Joe’s.</p>\n\n<h4><i>Recommended Settings</i></h4>\n<p>Once you're in, go to the deck options. I recommend setting <strong>\"New cards/day\" to 500</strong> and <strong>\"Maximum reviews/day\" to 5000</strong>. That doesn't mean you’ll actually do that many, but these settings keep Anki from arbitrarily capping your learning. Don’t worry about messing with other settings—though if you’re curious, you can explore more in the <a href='https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html' target='_blank'>Anki Docs</a>.</p>\n\n<h4><i>Plugins You Should Definitely Install</i></h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Image Occlusion:</strong> Perfect for o-chem mechanisms, anatomy pathways, or memorizing complex visuals. <a href='https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155' target='_blank'>Download it here</a>.</li>\n  <li><strong>Edit Field During Review:</strong> Lets you quickly edit a card with <code>CTRL + click</code>. Saves you tons of time. <a href='https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/385888438' target='_blank'>Get it here</a>.</li>\n  <li><strong>Review Heatmap:</strong> Visualizes your study streak and motivates you to keep going. I’ve seen students get addicted to their streaks—and in this case, that’s a good thing. <a href='https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1771074083' target='_blank'>Install it here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"premade-decks\"><strong>Should I Use Pre-Made Decks?</strong></h2>\n<p>Yes… and no.</p>\n<p>Premade decks are great for <i>supplemental content review</i>. They help you passively absorb facts, identify content gaps, and reinforce foundational knowledge. You can check out a breakdown of the best premade decks <a href='/articles/premade-decks'>here</a>.</p>\n<p>But here's the truth: <strong>they're not enough on their own</strong>. If you want to deeply understand and retain the material, nothing beats making your own cards.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"your-own-deck\"><strong>Making Your Own Anki Deck</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Students always try to fight me on this, and understandably so. Making your own Anki deck is a lot of work. However, it is exactly the fact that it is a lot of work that makes it so important. Using someone else’s cards is like studying from someone else’s notes. Helpful, sure. But not personalized to your brain. I always tell my students this—and the ones who listen often see 20+ point jumps.</p><h3><strong>Why Should I Make My Own Deck?</strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s the science: When you make your own flashcards, you’re forced to actively engage with the material. You’re not just rereading someone else’s definitions—you’re reasoning through concepts, writing them in your own words, and <i>connecting them to what you already know</i> in your <strong>semantic network</strong>.</p>\n<p>This taps into <strong>elaborative rehearsal</strong>—a deeper, more meaningful form of memory encoding—versus the <strong>maintenance rehearsal</strong> you get with premade decks. You’re fitting new info into <i>your own</i> <strong>schemas</strong>, not someone else’s. That matters. Concepts stick better when they’re tied to your unique framework of understanding. Plus, with the <strong>self-reference effect</strong> and <strong>encoding specificity principle</strong> in play, your retention improves when material is personally relevant and encoded in the same context in which you’ll recall it.</p>\n<p>TL;DR: Personalized cards = better memory.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Setting Up a Deck</strong></h3>\n<p>In Anki, create a main deck called something like <strong>\"MCAT Master Deck\"</strong>. Then make <strong>subdecks</strong> for each section:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Biology</li>\n  <li>Biochemistry</li>\n  <li>General Chemistry</li>\n  <li>Organic Chemistry</li>\n  <li>Psychology</li>\n  <li>Sociology</li>\n  <li>CARS (yes, even for vocab you didn’t know)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also <strong>tag your cards</strong> for specific topics (e.g., 'amino-acids', 'electrostatics', 'neurotransmitters'). This makes it easier to find and review specific concepts later.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>How and When Should I Make Cards?</strong></h3>\n<p>The golden rule: <strong>Create a card every time you realize you don’t understand something during practice.</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t just copy the question—figure out <strong>why</strong> you got it wrong. Then write an Anki card that captures that insight. This ensures you’re learning <strong>from your mistakes</strong>, not repeating them. You can see a step-by-step breakdown of how to do this at <a href='/articles/practice-question-to-anki-card'>Practice Question to Anki Card</a>.</p>\n<p>Yes, you can also make cards from Kaplan, Princeton Review, or Khan Academy videos—but only if it’s something you genuinely didn’t understand. Otherwise, you’ll overload yourself with cards you don’t actually need.</p>\n<p>If you're aiming for a 520+, that level of intensity might be worth it. But for most students, <strong>less is more—if the cards are high-quality</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion: Build a Deck That Works for You</strong></h2>\n<p>Making your own Anki deck is more work—but that’s why it works. It’s built around your strengths, your weaknesses, your thought process.</p>\n<p>At <strong>WozPrep</strong>, that’s what we’re all about. Our mission is to replace one-size-fits-all strategies with <strong>human-centered, personalized MCAT prep</strong>.

They’re great for reinforcing facts, memorizing Psych/Soc definitions, or hammering down physics formulas. They help you passively absorb content, identify knowledge gaps, and solidify foundational understanding. </p>\n<p> But here’s the thing: <strong>They won’t do the work for you.</strong> If you want to actually retain and apply what you’re learning, <a href='/articles/how-to-use-anki'><strong>you should be making your own cards</strong></a>.</p>\n<p> Still, premade decks have their place—especially when used intentionally. Let’s walk through the best options out there so you can decide what fits your style. This is not a comprehensive list by any means, but it covers the most popular decks out there. If you want more options, check out <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/AnkiMCAT' target='_blank'>r/AnkiMCAT</a></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Comprehensive Decks</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>1. MileDown’s Anki Deck</strong></h3>\n<p><a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1neyVXp_prnmVManHHCB6lZOOL6xEykPE/view' target='_blank'>Download Deck</a> | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/cckw41/my_anki_deck/' target='_blank'>Learn More</a></p>\n<p>This is the classic. It is my personal favorite premade MCAT Anki deck, and I used it to supplement my own deck when studying. The <i>Essential Equations</i> and <i>Behavioral</i> sections are particularly helpful. Based on a <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/12GGTfWWmj9bT-ejs4qAomV6Pat1tbDgj/view' target='_blank'><strong>90-page review PDF</strong></a> and the <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mu7NfacpCUngINZbt0S3s7Vjeja2jV_8/view' target='_blank'><strong>300-page Khan Psych/Soc doc </strong></a>. It has around <strong>2,900 well-made cards</strong>, clean visuals, good formatting, and essential equations.</p>\n<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Organized by subject, easy to navigate</li>\n  <li>Includes graphics, links to Khan Academy videos</li>\n  <li>Great entry-level or review deck—covers most high-yield content</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Lacks some advanced details</li>\n  <li>Not actively updated</li>\n</ul>\n\n <h3><strong>2.

It’s actively updated via AnkiHub, meaning bugs get fixed, cards get improved, and UWorld tagging continues to grow.</p>\n<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Continuously updated and improved</li>\n  <li>UWorld integration with hundreds of question IDs tagged</li>\n  <li>Pixorize tags for easy video review</li>\n  <li>Based on tried-and-true resources like MileDown</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Requires AnkiHub subscription</li>\n  <li>Can be overwhelming due to the sheer number of cards</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>3.

It pulls from Kaplan, Khan Academy, UWorld, Blueprint, and more. It's designed to be a supplemental deck you use to drill down on weak areas.</p>\n<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Extremely detailed and comprehensive</li>\n  <li>Chronologically ordered (can follow Kaplan chapters)</li>\n  <li>Perfect for filling content gaps identified during practice</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Too large for most people to use start-to-finish</li>\n  <li>Not meant for primary content review—use with books/videos</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>4. Abdullah’s Deck Combo</strong></h3>\n<p><a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hJh-CDoI0WdqL7E9idmwVYeNWrKvgPOx/view?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>Download Deck</a> | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/AnkiMCAT/comments/l4cx64/introducing_abdullahs_deck_almost_the_most/' target='_blank'>Learn More</a></p>\n<p>This deck is actually a fusion of three: <strong>Ortho528 (revamped)</strong>, <strong>Abdullah's Kaplan cloze deck</strong>, and a <strong>Cubene-based P/S cloze deck</strong>. If you’re a fan of cloze deletions and multimedia support, this one’s for you.</p>\n<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Visual-heavy (images, gifs, memes, Khan excerpts)</li>\n  <li>Follows Kaplan and Examkrackers material closely</li>\n  <li>Highly structured with tags and topic-based organization</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Some sections are incomplete (especially Gen Chem)</li>\n  <li>Requires manual unsuspending and tag navigation</li>\n</ul>\n\n <h3><strong>5.

It’s content-rich and tag-driven (not divided into subdecks). A great option if you want structured but in-depth review.</p>\n<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Tag-heavy for easy filtering</li>\n  <li>Made from scratch for complete MCAT coverage</li>\n  <li>Includes Biochem, Psych/Soc, and Physics content</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>No subdecks—less flexible for organization</li>\n  <li>Some AAMC content may be included</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>6. JackSparrow MCAT Anki Deck</strong></h3>\n<p><a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hIbhOPsbE-Ir4V5ONSSk345wVXzLqip2/view' target='_blank'>Download Deck</a> | <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/AnkiMCAT/comments/ig4jn8/jacksparrow2048_updated_deck/' target='_blank'>Learn More</a></p>\n<p>This one comes with a disclaimer: <strong>it wasn’t meant to be published</strong>. Jack Sparrow scored a 527 on the MCAT and only shared this deck because other premeds kept asking. As a result, it’s very raw and deeply personal to how <i>he</i> studied, just like how <strong>you should make your own deck that is deeply personal to you</strong>.</p><p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Helped Jack Sparrow score a 527 on the MCAT</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Lots of copy-pasted explanations from missed questions</li><li>Heavy on paragraphs and context that may not translate well to others</li><li>Includes spoilers from Kaplan, UWorld, AAMC material</li></ul>\n\n<p> While this deck clearly worked for its creator, <em>it probably won’t work for you</em>. It’s too tailored to one person’s thought process, and there are better-organized, more user-friendly decks available. But again, it provides a good example of how <strong>making your own Anki deck will work best for you</strong>. Jack Sparrow did it, and he got a 527.</p><h2><strong>Subject-Specific Decks</strong></h2>\n\n<h3><strong>1. MCAT Physics Equations Deck</strong></h3>\n<p><a href='https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/19895586' target='_blank'>Download Deck</a></p>\n<p>Need to drill physics formulas? This deck covers almost every equation from the Kaplan Physics book, complete with SI unit breakdowns. I personally used this deck to memorize C/P formulas. It does deeper than MileDown’s essential equations with derivations and units.</p>\n<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Focused on equations and their derivations</li>\n  <li>Good for test-day formula fluency</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Not conceptual—purely equations</li>\n  <li>Missing Some Formulas</li>\n</ul>\n\n <h3><strong>2. MrPankow’s Psych/Soc Deck</strong></h3>\n<p><a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zcni3moeevG20iEuKHa443VljXck9Er1/view?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>Download Deck</a></p>\n<p>This P/S deck is often cited as the <i>most educational</i> of the bunch. It doesn’t just test you—it teaches you. If you’re looking to master Psych/Soc, this might be your best bet.</p>\n<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Detailed, explanatory cards</li>\n  <li>Goes beyond definitions to include applied understanding</li>\n  <li>Great for active learning</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Very long—2,254 cards</li>\n  <li>Some content may be lower-yield</li>\n</ul>\n\n <h3><strong>3. Periodic Table Memory Pegs</strong></h3>\n<p><a href='https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/490209917' target='_blank'>Download Deck</a></p>\n<p>This is a niche deck for memorizing the periodic table using picture mnemonics and visual cues. Might be fun for some—but not essential for everyone.</p>\n<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Helpful visual mnemonics</li>\n  <li>Covers all 118 elements</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Probably overkill—periodic table is provided on test day</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts: Try, Tweak, or Build Your Own</strong></h2>\n<p>Premade decks are fantastic starting points. Try a few. Mix and match if you want. But in the end, <strong>this trial-and-error process might be more work than just building your own deck</strong> from your practice question mistakes and weak areas.</p>\n<p>If you’re aiming for serious score improvement, <a href='/articles/how-to-use-anki'>building your own deck</a>—in your own words—is the way to go.</p>\n<p>That’s what I help students do every day at <strong>WozPrep</strong>.

      "contents": "<p>Embarking on the MCAT journey is no small feat. At <strong>WozPrep</strong>, we understand that the path to medical school is as unique as each student. Our mission is to provide personalized guidance tailored to your individual needs. Let's delve into the best materials and strategies for effective MCAT content review.</p>\n\n<h2>General Advice on Content Review</h2>\n\n<p>Before diving into specific resources, it's crucial to approach content review with the right mindset:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Familiarization Over Memorization:</strong> The goal isn't to memorize every detail but to understand overarching concepts. This foundation will serve you well during practice questions and exams.</li>\n  <li><strong>Limit Note-Taking:</strong> Resist the urge to transcribe information. Instead, focus on active engagement with the material.</li>\n  <li><strong>Prioritize Practice:</strong> Transition to practice questions as soon as possible. Use missed questions to identify and review weak areas.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Khan Academy: A Visual Learner's Paradise</h2>\n\n<p>In my own MCAT preparation, I initially turned to Kaplan books. However, I soon discovered the unparalleled value of <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat\" target=\"_blank\">Khan Academy</a>. I wish I had started there from the beginning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Khan Academy?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Visual Learning:</strong> Their videos, enriched with diagrams and animations, cater to visual learners.</li>\n  <li><strong>Official Collaboration:</strong> Developed in partnership with the AAMC, ensuring alignment with test content.</li>\n  <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Completely free, making it accessible to all students.</li>\n  <li><strong>Interactive Practice:</strong> Short quizzes accompany each section, allowing you to assess your understanding before diving deeper.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Note:</em> Khan Academy's MCAT course will remain available until 2026, thanks to continued support from the AAMC. They've also updated over 80 passages in the Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems section to enhance your study experience.</p>\n\n<h2>Kaplan: Comprehensive Reading Material</h2>\n\n<p>For those who prefer structured reading, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Complete-7-Book-Subject-2025-2026-Practice/dp/1506294383\" target=\"_blank\">Kaplan MCAT Complete 7-Book Subject Review 2025-2026</a> is a solid choice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Structured Content:</strong> Each chapter begins with a quiz to assess prior knowledge and ends with practice passages.</li>\n  <li><strong>Visual Aids:</strong> Full-color illustrations, charts, and diagrams simplify complex topics.</li>\n  <li><strong>Practice Tests:</strong> Includes three full-length online practice exams.</li>\n  <li><strong>Expert Insights:</strong> Authored by seasoned instructors, providing strategic test-taking tips.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Note:</em> While Kaplan's practice tests are rigorous, they may yield lower scores than the actual MCAT.
