    "contents": "<p>I was raised Catholic. I went through all the sacraments. I took all the classes. But I never truly <i>knew</i> God. During high school, I became more and more invested in science, and I began to come to the conclusion that religion was just a silly fairy tale; a way to explain ancient mysteries that now found explanations in science. I became an atheist. I thought to myself: “Put me in a debate with any priest, and I will destroy them.” I thought I was so smart. I thought I had it all figured out. I thought that we could explain everything within a scientific, materialist framework.</p><p>During this time, I began to convince myself that I could be a “good” person without religion. I didn’t <i>need</i> religion, or God, or a savior, to be a good person – I was already a good person. Yet, I conveniently glossed over the ever-increasing immorality in my life. I started getting in intense arguments with my parents about religion. Science became an idol to me. My pride was through the roof. I engaged in countless acts of sexual immorality. I stole from my employer. I started vaping, and drinking alcohol, and smoking weed.</p><p>Then one night, sitting in my room alone, as I was about to sin, I felt the grace of God touch my heart. I dropped to my knees, and I cried. For hours. Yes, the same person who had argued that God was a “delusion” was now on his knees, crying more intensely than he ever had in his entire life. I felt God’s sorrow for me as all the sin I had committed over the last 10 years played like a filmstrip in my mind. I pleaded with God to have mercy on me, a sinner. I promised Him, “never again.”</p><p>Surely enough, just later that week, I was back in my sin again. And it only got worse and worse for the next year. When people asked me about religion, I would say “I don’t really know.” Yet, I knew. I had encountered God, and it seemed to have slipped my mind.</p><blockquote><p>They made a calf at Horeb<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and worshiped a cast image.<br />They exchanged the glory of God<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the image of an ox that eats grass.<br />They forgot God, their Savior,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who had done great things in Egypt.</p> <p>— Psalm 106:19–21 (NRSV)</p> </blockquote><p>Then, about a year later, I was sitting in my room alone again, probably about to engage in some shameless sin, when I saw the cross my grandmother gave me years ago on my desk. <strong>I hadn’t seen that cross in years.</strong> I moved multiple times since I first got that cross, and I forgot it even existed. I had absolutely no explanation for how it got there. I put it on, and again, I fell to my knees crying. The Lord reminded me of the promise I made him just last year, and as I realized how short I had fallen on my promise, my crying intensified.</p><blockquote><p>The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.</p><p>— Luke 22:61-62 (NIV)</p></blockquote><p>Around this time, I started to feel the conviction of the Holy Spirit for what felt like the first time in my life. My guilt for my sins was piling up. I had to confess. And I did. I told two of the closest people in my life the things that I tried to hide for years.</p><blockquote><p>We have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God.</p><p>— 2 Corinthians 4:2 (NIV)</p></blockquote><p>These people were hurt. They were uncomfortable. They saw me for who I truly was, rather than the façade I had put on. I was no longer trying to be someone to please others, I let my deepest secrets shine through. And it was one of the hardest things I ever did, but it was liberating.</p><p>However, I still had not fully given my life to Christ. I didn’t start reading the Bible, I didn’t start going to church. God became an afterthought yet again. And again, I started to slip. <strong>I was still living in sin.</strong></p><blockquote><p>He told them many things in parables, saying: “Listen! A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seeds fell on the path, and the birds came and ate them up. Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and they sprang up quickly, since they had no depth of soil. But when the sun rose, they were scorched; and since they had no root, they withered away … As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; yet such a person has no root, but endures only for a while, and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word, that person immediately falls away.</p> <p>— Matthew 13:3-6,20-21 (NRSV)</p> </blockquote><p>Another year later, I was riding a jetski on the lake with friends. Suddenly, they took off, and my jetski broke down. I looked around, and there were no boats in sight. I was all alone, and I paddled myself over to the shore. I found the dock where it looked least likely that someone lived because I didn’t want to bother anyone. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, the man who owned the dock pulled in on his boat, eager to take me home.</p><p>For some reason, in this experience, I recognized for the first time that there was a reality beyond the material. I couldn’t explain where the man came from, or why he helped me. When I returned to the lake house, I started seeing everything this way. I was connecting with people in ways I never had before. I felt like I was seeing people’s souls, not just their bodies. And in all of this, I was shown undeniable evidence that God exists.</p><blockquote><p>Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.” Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God.</p><p>— Luke 18:42-43 (NIV)</p></blockquote><p>I couldn’t deny it anymore, and I started sharing my experience with friends and coworkers. Some explained my experience with New Age Spirituality, others explained it with Islam. I looked into the beliefs others shared with me, and I tried desperately to incorporate them into my life. Yet deep down, I still didn’t feel satisfied. <strong>I was still running away from Jesus</strong>. Eventually, however, I ended up buying my first Bible, and I turned to the gospels:</p><blockquote><p>Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”</p><p>— John 14:6 (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p>Reading the text, <strong>I knew it was true</strong>. The same voice that had spoken to me over the last 3 years was the same one I found in the gospels. I didn’t find that voice in the Qur’an, or New Age beliefs, or anything else. But when I read the Sermon on the Mount, when I heard his parables, when I learned about his healings, I just <i>knew</i> it was him calling to me all that time.</p><blockquote><p>My sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me.</p><p>— John 10:27 (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p>My life completely changed. The hours I used to spend in shameful acts were now spent diligently studying the Word of God. It wasn’t just a book I was reading, <strong>He was speaking to me through the pages</strong>. It was like nothing I ever experienced before. I fell in love.</p><blockquote><p>Indeed, the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul from spirit, joints from marrow; it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</p><p>— Hebrews 4:12 (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p>Even reading the Bible, something was still missing. Yes, many of the chains that once held me back were broken. I wasn’t smoking anymore, I wasn’t watching porn, I wasn’t drinking, and I wasn’t stealing. But I still found myself struggling with sin. Then, I took another look at the Gospel of John:</p><blockquote><p>Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.”</p><p>— John 6:35 (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p>I already realized Jesus was the metaphorical bread of life. The hunger and thirst that I used to satiate with the idols of science, drugs, and sex were satisfied in a way they never had been once I directed those impulses toward him. But I kept reading on:</p><blockquote><p>“Very truly, I tell you, whoever believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life … I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh … Very truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day; for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me, and I in them.”</p><p>— John 6:47-48,51,53-56 (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p>I read these words over and over, and over again. Sure, Jesus used metaphor to describe himself as “the light of the world” (John 8:12) and as “the gate for the sheep” (John 10:7), but <strong>there was something objectively different about his language in the Bread of Life Discourse</strong>. And there was something emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually different about it too. After I read those words, I looked into the Eucharist. I felt the utmost urgency to make it to mass at a Catholic church that next Sunday.</p><p>And when I made it, I instantly fell in love with the beauty of the church. Although I had once felt bored in church, <strong>I now wished the liturgy could never end</strong>.</p><p>And then the time came to receive Holy Communion. And… I didn’t feel much. In fact, that week I started to feel more guilt than I had in a long time. I felt the conviction of the Holy Spirit more than I ever had before.</p><blockquote><p>Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be answerable for the body and blood of the Lord. Examine yourselves, and only then eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For all who eat and drink without discerning the body, eat and drink judgment against themselves.</p><p>— 1 Corinthians 11:27-29 (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p>I realized I needed to get to the sacrament of confession as soon as possible. That week, I started listing out all of the sins I had committed in the last 12 years. From stealing, to sexual immorality, to idolatry, and everything in between.</p><p>When I got to the church, I was shaking in the car, and I almost left without going in. <strong>I worried about how bad my penance was going to be for all the evil I had done</strong>. But I called to the Holy Spirit and He guided me into the church. I sat down in line, and I opened up my Bible, hoping to find comfort. The page I flipped to was right in the middle of the Gospel of Luke. I read:</p><blockquote><p>I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.</p><p>— Luke 15:7 (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p>My trembling hands started to find some rest. I continued reading:</p><blockquote><p>Jesus said, “… ‘I will get up and go to my father, and I will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired hands.”’ So he set off and went to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion; he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him.</p><p>— Luke 15:11,18-20 (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p>I heard the voice of the Father tell me that was going to be my penance. <strong>I doubted whether it was truly Him</strong>. Then, it was my turn to go into the confessional.</p><p>With a shaky voice, I confessed: “Bless me father, for I have greatly sinned. It has been 12 years since my last confession.”</p><p>A soothing voice replied, “Welcome back.”</p><p>And so I started listing my sins. Every last one that I could remember. When I heard the words of absolution, <strong>the weight of sin I felt on my heart had lifted</strong>, and when the priest told me my penance was to read Luke 15, <strong>I felt like I was flying</strong>. In that confessional, I experienced the love of God so much more than I ever had before. I realized more deeply than ever what John meant when he wrote:</p><blockquote><p>Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God; everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love. God’s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.</p><p>— 1 John 4:7-10 (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p>The same person who was an atheist just years before was now confessing:</p><blockquote><p>My soul yearns<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the Lord.<br />My stomach is empty<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without His body,<br />My tongue parched<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without His blood.</p><p>Search my heart, O God!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach into the depths of my soul.<br />Breathe life into me, O God!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May you be all I know.</p></blockquote><p>The same person who was an atheist just years before was now brought to tears when the priest uttered the words of consecration over the altar. That same person now sits here writing this story, longing for the next opportunity to receive the most blessed sacrament, praying that even one person will read this story and come back to the Lord Jesus.</p><blockquote><p> He who sat on the throne said, “<strong>Behold, I make all things new</strong>.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”</p><p>— Revelation 21:5 (NKJV)</p></blockquote>",

    "contents": "<p>I once stood in the same shoes as the doubter, staring into the void of reality and whispering to myself: there has to be more than this. And yet, for so long, I convinced myself that there wasn’t. I sought a spirituality detached from God, drawn more to the mysterious notion of an 'unseen reality' than to any personal deity. I admired the elegance of quantum physics, the philosophical allure of Kant’s noumenal world, the poetic pull of consciousness studies—but God? No. God was a distant myth I had left on the altar of my childhood.</p>\n\n<p>And then something changed.</p>\n\n<p>The conversation I recently had with a friend reopened this wound—this deep divide between belief and skepticism. He said he’s open to 'something unseen,' perhaps a force, a realm, or a presence beyond the senses, but not God. Not the God of the Bible. Not the God who, in his view, committed genocide, endorsed slavery, and now stands eternally silent. He asked a damning question: What has God done recently?</p>\n\n<p>That’s a fair question. It’s a deeply human question. One I’ve asked myself in the quiet, lonely nights when prayers seem to echo off the ceiling. He argued that he can be more moral than God. That, unlike God, he holds himself accountable. That God ruled by destruction and fear. That any change made by man can be attributed to man—but what can be attributed to God, today?</p>\n\n<p>But I would ask this: is morality truly grounded if it floats upon the shifting tides of human culture? What is evil, really, if we define it ourselves? If you define it one way, and I define it another, and both of us shift our definition a decade from now, who’s to say which of us is right? Scripture says:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness.”</p><p>— Isaiah 5:20 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>God doesn’t operate on our scale. That was my mistake for years. I thought if I couldn’t understand God, then He must not exist. But I’ve come to believe the opposite: <strong>if I could fully understand God, then He wouldn’t be God</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I get the revulsion to the Old Testament stories. I once flinched at them too. The flood. The destruction of Sodom. The commands against enemy nations. They seemed harsh, maybe even cruel. But I began to realize that we cannot read divine justice through the lens of modern sentimentality. We are not God. We are not omniscient. We see the page. He holds the book.</p>\n\n<p>He’s not a celestial dictator. He’s a loving Father who allows freedom and consequence. Justice and mercy. He warns before He acts. He offers covenants. He pleads through prophets. He delays judgment far longer than any human judge would. And when humanity still rejected Him, He came down—not with thunder, but with tears, in the form of Christ. He didn’t bring down fire. He lifted up a cross.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.”</p><p>— Psalm 103:8 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand what it feels like to live in sin and to believe that God is silent. I lived there. I lived in patterns of self-justification, sin, and shame. I lied to myself, numbed myself, told myself I was strong and wise and moral. But I was empty. I had no anchor. My sense of good was subjective and self-serving. I couldn’t stop. Not by willpower. Not by intellect. It wasn’t until I fell apart that I cried out—truly cried out—and felt something shift.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</p><p>— Galatians 2:20 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>When I handed my life over to Christ, I didn’t get a mystical light show. I didn’t hear an audible voice. I didn’t get riches or supernatural healing. What I got was clarity. Peace. A stillness I had never known. Slowly, sins that had bound me lost their grip. I saw people differently. I saw myself differently. My heart softened. That wasn’t from me. That was the work of God in me.</p><blockquote><p>So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.</p><p>— 2 Corinthians 5:16-19 (NIV)</blockquote><p>As to the silence of God—yes, it’s hard. We want parting seas and tongues of fire. We want lightning bolts. But maybe God is speaking more quietly now, because He has already said the loudest thing He could possibly say. We are not waiting for new words. The Word already came. God became flesh. He touched the lepers. He wept over the dead. He washed the feet of sinners. And yes, He died. But He also rose.</p>\n\n<p>To the objection that faith lacks accountability, I would argue the opposite. True faith brings the deepest accountability. If God is real, then I can no longer hide. I am known. Seen. Judged not just by my actions but by the motives of my heart. That is terrifying. And liberating. Because He doesn’t only judge—He forgives. But I had to confess. I had to repent. And I still do, daily.</p><blockquote><p>Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that <strong>what they have done has been done in the sight of God.</strong></p><p>— John 3:20-21 (NIV)</p></blockquote><p>The miracles may look different now. Maybe they aren’t parted seas but reconciled families. Not water to wine, but anxiety to peace. Not blind eyes opened, but hardened hearts softened. These aren’t lesser miracles. They are greater.</p>\n\n<p>At the heart of it all, there is still that question: why believe in a God you cannot see?</p>\n\n<p>To that, I offer the same words Jesus gave to Thomas, the doubter, the one who demanded empirical proof—the same kind of proof modern skeptics demand:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Then Jesus told him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”</p><p>— John 20:29 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>That is where I place my trust. Not in probabilities or shifting moralities. But in a love so deep that it entered the story and took my place. I once was blind to it. But now I see. And even when I do not see, I believe.</p>",

    "contents": "<p>There are questions so heavy that even the most brilliant minds tremble before them. Among the heaviest is this: <strong>if God is all-loving and all-powerful, why does He allow evil?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This question is not academic. It's personal. It doesn’t come from a vacuum—it comes from pain. From the horrors we’ve seen or heard. From the young girl raped. From the war orphan. From the silence that often follows our prayers. And if God is real, if He sees everything, then doesn’t His silence make Him complicit?</p>\n\n<p>That’s where the argument begins: if God is everywhere, then He must be either inactive or cruel. He must be either powerless or morally bankrupt. And if He is not doing something about evil—especially the brutal kind—then what good is He at all?</p>\n\n<p>I hear that. I’ve felt it. But I also think the question is misdirected. When we see evil, we don’t just grieve—we judge. We call it evil because something deep in us believes it should not be so. We believe there’s a way the world <em>ought</em> to be. And where doe that sense of \"ought\" come from?</p>\n\n<p>If evil breaks your heart, you are not alone. Scripture tells us it breaks God's heart too. When He saw the wickedness of the earth before the flood, it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.”</p><p>— Genesis 6:6 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<p>People recoil at the flood story—and for good reason. It's harsh. It feels indiscriminate. It raises the haunting question: <strong>How much evil would justify God wiping out the whole earth?</strong></p>\n\n<p>But that’s not where the story ends. After the flood, God makes a promise:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done.”</p><p>— Genesis 8:21 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this, I see not cruelty but lamentation—a God who is devastated by the state of His creation. A God who acts, and then vows never to act in that same way again. The arc of Scripture bends not toward wrath, but toward grace. And Jesus becomes the ultimate proof of this.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.”</p><p>— Matthew 5:38-42 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is where everything shifts. God does not merely intervene <em>on</em> us. He intervenes <em>through</em> us. And in Christ, He intervenes <em>as</em> one of us. This changes the very framework of the problem. Instead of asking why God doesn't stop evil, the question becomes: <strong>why don’t we?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are not passive observers in this story. We are moral agents. We are invited to be the hands and feet of God—to bring justice, comfort, healing, and love where we can. When I see unjust suffering, I believe God is not absent. I believe He is calling <em>me</em> to respond. And if I choose not to, then I am the one being complacent—not Him.</p>\n\n<p>And here is where I want to get very honest. I’ve done wrong. I’ve acted out of selfishness. Even as a child, I remember making decisions that hurt others. And when I look around, I see the same pattern. We all know, deep down, that we’ve done wrong. The word we use in the Church is <strong>sin</strong>. I know it’s not a popular word. It makes people squirm. But maybe that’s because it hits close to home. Maybe because we know it’s true.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><strong>For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.</strong></p><p>— Romans 3:23 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s this notion today that we’re born good, and that the world just corrupts us. But the Bible offers a more painful and yet more hopeful view: we are <em>capable</em> of good, but bent toward self. We were created in God’s image, yes—but we are also broken. And that brokenness explains a lot more of human history than blanket optimism ever could.</p>\n\n<p>If you think that’s bleak, stay with me. Because the message of Christianity is not that we’re sinners doomed to suffer. It’s that God saw our mess, entered into it, and gave His life to redeem it. He didn’t wipe out humanity again—He took on humanity’s sin Himself.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><strong>And all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.</strong> God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished—he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.</p><p>— Romans 3:24-26 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some say, “Why should I believe God will bring justice?” Because Jesus said He would. And He died—and came back to life—to prove He keeps His promises. He showed that injustice is not the end. Death is not the end. Evil is not the end.</p>\n\n<p>The skeptics say, “That’s circular.” Maybe. But so is most of human reasoning if you trace it far enough. At some point, we all have to choose what foundation we’re standing on. Mine is not a myth or blind hope—it’s a person. A man who lived, suffered, forgave, and rose again. A man who looked into the eyes of His murderers and said, \"Father, forgive them.\" That is strength. That is justice. That is love.</p><p>I don’t claim to have all the answers. But I do believe this: evil exists. We’ve all seen it. We’ve all participated in it. And we all need saving from it. Christ came to offer that salvation, not just as an abstract idea, but as a way of life—a way that invites us to forgive, to heal, and to hope.</p><blockquote><p> This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: <strong>not that we loved God, but that he loved us</strong> and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.</p><p>— 1 John 4:9-10 (NIV)</blockquote><p>If you’re angry about evil, I’m with you. But let that anger fuel justice, not despair. Let it drive you toward the God who feels it too. And who gave everything to make it right.</p>",    "image": [],

    "contents": "<p>One of the most common objections to belief in God is the accusation that God is merely a placeholder—a relic of pre-scientific ignorance, a filler of gaps in understanding. The argument follows this line: we used to invoke God to explain what we couldn't understand, but now that science can explain nearly everything from the formation of galaxies to the firing of neurons, there's no explanatory role left for God to play. And if God is no longer necessary for explanation, then God is simply an outdated hypothesis—an intellectual cop-out. Worse yet, some take it further: if God is truly all-powerful and everywhere, why does He sit back while evil and suffering ravage the innocent?</p> \n\n<p>These are serious and emotionally charged questions. They deserve to be taken seriously. But let me respond with clarity and conviction: Christianity does not propose a God-of-the-gaps. It never has. Instead, it proclaims a God who is the source of all being—the ground not only of what we don’t know, but of everything we do know.</p>\n\n<p>Let me explain the core issue more clearly. The skeptic in this case argues:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>God is invoked to explain things science has not yet explained.</li>\n  <li>As science progresses, the need for God decreases.</li>\n  <li>Therefore, God is a human invention used to paper over ignorance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But this formulation misunderstands both science and theology. Theological claims are not meant to compete with scientific ones. When we say God created the world, we are not denying gravity, the strong nuclear force, or biological evolution. Rather, we are saying that these scientific realities themselves are contingent—that they did not have to exist, and yet they do. Their very existence cries out for explanation. Why should anything exist rather than nothing?</p>\n\n<p>If I build a watch and someone discovers how it works, that doesn’t make me any less the watchmaker. It makes me more impressive. Similarly, the more we understand the intricate order of the universe, the more reason we have to believe in an intelligent Creator. Understanding the laws of physics doesn't erase God—it reveals His fingerprints.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\"For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.\"</p><p>— Romans 1:20 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<p>So no, God is not the answer to gaps. God is the answer to why there is anything at all. And that’s not a retreat into mysticism—it’s a metaphysical necessity. Even science rests on preconditions it cannot prove: the uniformity of nature, the rational intelligibility of the universe, and the reliability of the human mind. Christianity offers a foundation for all of these. Materialism does not.</p>\n\n<p>If you approach God as something to be disproven before you've even heard the answer, then of course you'll find only silence. But if you approach with openness—not blind faith, but genuine curiosity—you may just discover that everything you've loved about this world points to a deeper beauty. One that doesn't erase suffering but redeems it. One that doesn't replace science but undergirds it. One that doesn't coddle, but calls. God is not a crutch. He is the cornerstone.</p><blockquote><p>Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.</p><p>— Matthew 7:7-8 (NIV)</blockquote>",    "image": [],

    "contents": "<p>The introduction of <a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06600-9' target='_blank'><strong>Assembly Theory</strong></a> has prompted many to assert that we no longer need a divine Creator to explain the origin of life. This position, however, not only overstates what Assembly Theory (AT) achieves but misunderstands the nature of the argument for God. While AT provides a promising framework for understanding how selection may work in chemical and biological systems, it presupposes a kind of constraint and memory that it cannot itself account for without appealing—implicitly or otherwise—to a designer or transcendent source of order.</p>  \n\n<h3>Understanding the Dissenter’s Claim</h3>\n<p>The dissenting position is that we do not need a Creator because AT demonstrates how small, favorable changes over time are selected, increasing the likelihood of complex objects like the ribosome. Through recursive steps, AT models how objects build upon previous assemblies, and thus how molecular complexity can grow over time without divine intervention. As one proponent puts it: “Each 'change' is constrained by what came before it... evolution doesn't need to design a ribosome all at once.” The copy-paste mechanism of biological evolution is used as evidence of randomness constrained by prior structure—not divine intention.</p>\n\n<h3>Why This Still Doesn’t Eliminate God</h3>\n<p>This sounds appealing until one pauses to ask: what constrains the assembly process in the first place? The AT paper itself acknowledges:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"More objects exist in assembly space than can be built in finite time with finite resources because the space of possibilities grows super-exponentially with the assembly index.\"</p><p>— Sharma <i>et al</i>. (2023)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Without constraint, the space of possible assemblies becomes unsearchable. The paper states that for complex objects to emerge, they must be guided by objects in the environment that act as constraints—like enzymes—but those enzymes must themselves already exist. This is not a problem solved by AT; it is merely restated in new mathematical language. What selects the selectors? What creates the constraints that allow non-random assembly paths to emerge?</p>\n\n<p>The paper asserts:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There must be objects in its environment that can constrain the steps to assemble the object.”</p><p>— Sharma <i>et al</i>. (2023)</p></blockquote>\n<p>But if one is explaining the <i>origin</i> of those very constraints—say, ribozymes capable of catalyzing replication—then AT runs into the same problem it seeks to overcome: that the likelihood of generating such a molecule randomly, even over vast periods of time, is super-exponentially small. For example, if it took only five recursive steps to build the ribosome, the number of competing molecular forms that could emerge instead is on the order of 10<sup>64</sup>. The chances of hitting the one path that leads to a self-replicating molecule become vanishingly small.</p>\n\n<h3>Faith in Time vs. Faith in God</h3>\n<p>Some argue that given enough time, complexity is inevitable. But we must be honest—this is a form of faith. As Christians, we acknowledge mystery, but our mystery is grounded in a Person: a Creator who reveals Himself not only through Scripture but through the intelligibility and order of the universe. <p>To rely on chemical reactions alone to explain life's origin—without a mechanism for preserving, copying, or shielding the assembly—is not science without God, it’s speculation without substance. The belief that we will <i>eventually</i> understand how to build a ribosome through abiotic conditions is not unlike believing a tornado could assemble a Boeing 747 from a scrapyard—except the ribosome is orders of magnitude more complex.</p><blockquote> <p>Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.</p><p>— 1 Corinthians 1:20-21 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<h3>But What About Selection?</h3>\n<p>Even if one grants that recursive selection processes can guide assembly, the question remains: who or what selects? AT suggests that certain objects in the environment “persist” to guide new assembly steps. But persistence itself implies survivability, replication, and shielding from degradation—all things that are impossible without a cell. In fact, the very conditions that may generate prebiotic molecules (like UV light or hydrothermal vents) are also the conditions most likely to degrade them. The Creator is not needed merely to jumpstart biology but to establish a universe where such pathways are even <i>possible</i>, let alone stable.</p>\n\n<h3>The Real Tension Is Not Between Science and Faith</h3>\n<p>The mistake is thinking that pointing to order in biology or physics disproves the need for God. On the contrary, it proves our deep desire to make sense of the ordered patterns we see. That desire itself is a reflection of the image of God in us. The scientific project does not undermine faith; it depends on it. The very concept of Assembly Theory is predicated on intelligibility, constraint, recursion, and selection—all signs of design, not chaos. The Apostle Paul writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made.”</p><p>— Romans 1:20 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Completeness, Not Blind Complexity</h3>\n<p>Assembly Theory brings new mathematical clarity to the problem of molecular complexity, but it does not solve the foundational problem of origin. We must go further. We must ask why there is order at all. Why there is any constraint. Why the universe allows recursive processes to create beauty, structure, and life. That is where Christianity speaks with power—not to the mechanisms of molecules, but to the meaning behind them.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, our understanding—whether through AT or any future theory—will always be partial. As the Apostle Paul so beautifully reminds us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“...where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears.”</p><p>— 1 Corinthians 13:8–10 (NIV)</blockquote>\n<p>The completeness is not found in the atom, the molecule, or the recursive step. <strong>It is found in Christ.</strong> Science may teach us how life works, but only God reveals why life is worth living. That, above all else, is why the Creator still matters.</p>",

    "contents": "<p>There are few books in Scripture as haunting and provocative as <i>Job</i>. It is a book that cuts to the core of the human experience—suffering without clear cause—and dares to put God on trial. But perhaps even more daring is the conclusion it draws: that we, the finite, cannot sit in judgment of the Infinite.</p>\n\n<p>The common objection I’ve heard from atheists and skeptics alike is simple, pointed, and emotionally compelling: If God is good, why would He treat Job—and by extension, humanity—with such cruelty? Isn’t God, in the Book of Job, the cosmic equivalent of a tyrant, robbing a man of everything just to prove a point?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s be clear about the force of this objection. Job is described in the opening lines of the book as “blameless and upright.” He loses his children, wealth, and health. He curses the day he was born. He begs for answers. And when God finally responds, He does not provide the neat, satisfying explanation we crave. Instead, He speaks from a whirlwind and asks questions like:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me, if you understand.</p>\n<p>— Job 38:4 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The critic reads this and scoffs: “That’s it? That’s the divine justification?” Isn’t that like a mother dismissing her child’s pain with a hand wave: “You just wouldn’t understand.” To them, this is not an answer at all. But that’s because they misunderstand what kind of answer the Book of Job is offering.</p>\n\n<p>Job’s story isn’t about satisfying human curiosity. It’s about reorienting human pride. When God says:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Surely you know, for you were already born!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have lived so many years!</p>\n<p>— Job 38:21 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>He is not avoiding the question—He is redefining the very terms of the debate. God's rhetorical questions aren’t evasion. They are revelation. They unmask the hubris of thinking we, who exist for a mere blink in cosmic history, are in any position to evaluate the justice of the Eternal One.</p>\n\n<p>Some argue, “What if I robbed you of everything to test your loyalty—then gave you twice as much back? Would that justify it?” But this misses the theological point. The Book of Job never says the suffering was about the reward. It says suffering has a place in the divine order that we, from within time and flesh, cannot fully grasp. As the Apostle Paul would later write:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!</p>\n<p>— Romans 11:33 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>We want answers. Job wanted answers. But what Job got—and what we get—is something <strong>even better</strong>: a glimpse of God’s majesty, and a reminder of our smallness. In that context, even Job is humbled:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.</p>\n<p>— Job 42:3 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>And it’s not just Job who comes to see this. Scripture consistently affirms that our trust cannot rest solely on what we understand. Consider this:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Trust in the Lord with all your heart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lean not on your own understanding;<br />in all your ways submit to him,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will make your paths straight.</p>\n<p>— Proverbs 3:5–6 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The dissenting voice insists that this is just a cop-out, a way to excuse divine cruelty. But if we step back and reflect—not just theologically, but psychologically—we find this idea echoed in the very structure of the human mind. People often don’t know what they really need. We chase relationships or success thinking they will fulfill us, only to discover they don’t. In psychology, this is the insight of Maslow’s hierarchy and of psychoanalysis: unconscious needs drive behavior more than conscious ones. We aren’t even fully transparent to ourselves. So how could we expect to fully grasp the designs of a transcendent Creator?</p>\n\n<p>If we accept the premise that God is eternal, uncreated, and the very ground of being, then our moral comparisons fall apart. His justice is not our justice. His time is not our time. As God says through Isaiah:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“For my thoughts are not your thoughts,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither are your ways my ways,”<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the Lord.</p>\n<p>“As the heavens are higher than the earth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so are my ways higher than your ways<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my thoughts than your thoughts.”</p>\n<p>— Isaiah 55:8–9 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Faith does not mean intellectual suicide. It means recognizing the limits of human understanding and choosing trust where full knowledge is impossible. It means that even when we can’t explain the storm, we trust the One who speaks from it. And that trust leads to transformation, as it did for Job, who in the end receives not only restoration but a deeper relationship with the God he once questioned.</p>\n\n<p>So no, it is not insanity to say, “We just can’t know.” It’s humility. And in that humility, we find hope. As Job himself concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>My ears had heard of you but <strong>now my eyes have seen you</strong>.</p>\n<p>— Job 42:5 (NIV)</p></blockquote>",

    "contents": "<p>One of the most persistent objections to Christianity—and theism more broadly—centers on the idea that the universe, and life itself, could not possibly be the product of an intelligent Creator. This objection typically asserts that evolutionary biology, natural selection, and abiogenesis offer sufficient explanations for complexity and design, rendering God both unnecessary and implausible.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, I engaged with someone who, in response to a video discussing intelligent design, raised several key points that deserve a thoughtful reply. They argued that the notion of a designed universe mischaracterizes both evolution and intelligence itself. They claimed that intelligence is an emergent property, not something that preexists or designs. They further argued that comparisons between DNA and computer code are flawed and that the gaps in science do not constitute evidence for God.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s take these one at a time.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Is Intelligence Merely Emergent?</h3>\n<p>Yes, intelligence is commonly understood to be emergent—from the brain, from evolution, from billions of years of selection. But that’s only if we start with a materialist assumption. Suppose instead that intelligence is not something that arises from matter, but that matter is something understood only within mind. This is not a new idea—Descartes himself suggested that everything we know exists within the mind of God. The mind of God, being eternal, is the source of all intelligence.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>This is what the Lord says: “Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who draws strength from mere flesh and whose heart turns away from the Lord.”</p><p>— Jeremiah 17:5 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<p>If all that exists is physical and emergent, then even our own sense of logic, morality, and identity are illusions. But if they are not—if we trust our rationality, our minds, our consciousness—then we are already assuming something more than matter. And if our minds are real, they must reflect a greater Mind from which they came.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Evolution and Design: Competing or Complementary?</h3>\n<p>One of the strongest claims made was that natural selection is sufficient to explain biological complexity. I don’t entirely disagree—but what strikes me is that even when scientists try to replicate the origin of life in a lab, they always have to act as intelligent agents. When we try to create RNA self-replicating molecules, we set up controlled environments, finely tuned reactions, constrained inputs. In other words: the only way we can imagine life forming is by using intelligence to simulate it.</p>\n\n<p>So the irony is this: when we try to show that intelligence is unnecessary, we have to be intelligent to do it. We ourselves become the intelligent designers in our experiments. That’s not a coincidence. That’s a signal. It testifies to a deeper order—an intelligent Logos that underlies creation itself.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.</p><p>— John 1:1-5 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<h3>3. Functional Proteins and the Vastness of the Search Space</h3>\n<p>In my own lab experience, I’ve seen firsthand how difficult it is to generate functional biological molecules. We simulate antibodies to bind to cancer targets, yet even small changes in amino acids can result in complete dysfunction. Most mutations lead to nonviable forms. The number of possible protein combinations is so vast that the fraction of functionally useful ones is astronomically small. The fact that we somehow “landed” on functional proteins, metabolic pathways, and cell machinery is a statistical miracle—unless there was a Mind behind it.</p>\n\n<p>Could this have emerged over billions of years? Possibly. But to say “it’s possible” is not to say “it’s probable.” And when the probability is so close to zero, we are again faced with the same reality: either the universe is uniquely and miraculously ordered for life—or it is a statistical absurdity we pretend makes sense because we’re here to observe it.</p>\n\n<h3>4. The Problem of Fine-Tuning</h3>\n<p>Then there’s the fine-tuning of physical constants. Our universe is governed by a delicate set of parameters—gravity, electromagnetism, nuclear force—that, if altered slightly, would render life impossible. The Anthropic Principle is often invoked to dismiss this: \"we observe a life-permitting universe because if it weren’t, we wouldn’t be here.\" But that’s not an explanation. That’s just a tautology.</p>\n\n<p>It makes far more sense that the universe is the product of an Intelligence who intended life to exist. The order, the harmony, the structure—all of it is the language of a rational Mind. And historically, that is precisely how the scientific revolution began: under the conviction that a rational God created a rational world that could be understood by rational creatures made in His image.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.</p><p>— Romans 1:20 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<h3>5. Faith and Reason Are Not Enemies</h3>\n<p>One objection that came up is that religious scientists are “cherry-picking” their own data or misinterpreting research. But that assumes that science must always be in tension with faith. In reality, some of the most brilliant minds in history—Kepler, Pascal, Newton, Faraday, Mendel—were devoutly religious and saw their scientific work as a way to glorify God.</p>\n\n<p>The claim that “science cannot disprove God” is true—but so is the converse: science cannot prove that God doesn’t exist. The absence of physical proof for God is not evidence of absence—it’s evidence that God is not a physical object. He is the grounding of being itself. That is why you must seek Him not only with microscopes but with the heart.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>This is what the LORD says, he who made the earth, the LORD who formed it and established it—the LORD is his name: ‘Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.’</p><p>— Jeremiah 33:2-3 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Conclusion: From Chaos to Cosmos</h3>\n<p>To call the universe “unintelligently designed” is to take for granted the very laws that give you the ability to reason about it. The order we see in biology, chemistry, and physics is not random noise—it is structure, balance, and beauty. Our minds are not accidental—nor is the moral law within them. All of it reflects a Designer.</p>\n\n<p>So the next time someone says, “we don’t need God to explain the universe,” I invite them to look closer. The more you study the universe—the more you see how fragile life is, how tuned the cosmos must be, how rare and unlikely rational thought truly is—the harder it is to believe it’s all just an accident.</p>\n\n<p>The heavens still declare the glory of God.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The heavens declare the glory of God; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the skies proclaim the work of his hands. <br />Day after day they pour forth speech;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night after night they reveal knowledge.<br />They have no speech, they use no words;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no sound is heard from them.<br />Yet their voice goes out into all the earth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their words to the ends of the world.</p><p>— Psalm 19:1-4a (NIV)</blockquote>",

    "contents": "<p>Plato’s <i>Symposium</i> is more than just a philosophical dialogue—it is a spiritual masterpiece that offers one of the most profound meditations on love in Western philosophy.</p>\n\n<p>Its insights into the nature of love as self-sacrifice, as a longing for unity, and as a means of ascent toward the divine resonate deeply with biblical teachings. While Plato’s vision of love predates Christianity, its themes align so closely with Christian theology that one cannot help but see <i>Symposium</i> as a philosophical forerunner to the Christian understanding of God’s love.</p><blockquote><p>Love ... is the intermediate between the divine and the mortal … [Love] is the mediator who spans the chiasm and divides them, and therefore in [Love] all is bound together, and through [Love] the arts of the prophet and the priest, their sacrifices and mysteries and charms, and all prophecy and incantation, find their way. For God mingles not with man; but through Love all the intercourse and converse of God with man, whether awake or asleep, is carried on. The wisdom which understands this is spiritual.</p><p>— <i>Symposium</i></p></blockquote><p>The dialogue’s most striking insight is that <i>Eros</i>—far from being mere desire—is the force that compels humans toward ultimate truth and self-sacrifice. Plato’s assertion that “love will make men dare to die for their beloved” finds a powerful parallel in the Christian declaration:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.</p><p>— John 15:13 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<p>This elevates <i>Eros</i> beyond physical attraction, revealing it as the very energy that draws the soul toward divine reality.</p>\n\n<p>One of <i>Symposium</i>’s most moving passages is the myth of the divided humans, who spend their lives searching for their lost halves in an aching pursuit of wholeness. This longing is not merely for another person but for something beyond the beloved, an inexpressible unity that transcends physical form. Plato suggests that true love seeks to restore a unity that has been lost—an idea deeply resonant with Genesis:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.</p><p>— Genesis 2:24 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>...and with the Christian understanding that all human longing is, at its core, a yearning for divine communion. Love, then, is not just the desire for another but the soul’s attempt to reunite with the eternal.</p>\n\n<p>Diotima’s “Ladder of Love” presents <i>Eros</i> as an ascent from earthly beauty to the contemplation of divine Beauty itself. Beginning with love for an individual, the lover moves beyond physical attraction to appreciate the beauty of all things—bodies, souls, laws, and wisdom—until finally reaching the Form of the Good, which is eternal and unchanging.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>These are the lesser mysteries of love, into which even you, Socrates, may enter ... For he ... should begin in youth to visit beautiful forms ... and soon he will of himself perceive that the beauty of one form is akin to the beauty of another; and then if beauty of form in general is his pursuit, how foolish would he be not to recognize that the beauty in every form is and the same! ... When he perceives this he will abate his violent love of the one ... and will become a lover of all beautiful forms; in the next stage he will consider that the beauty of the mind is more honourable than the beauty of the outward form ... until he is compelled to contemplate and see the beauty of institutions and laws ... after laws and institutions he will go on to the sciences, that he may see their beauty ... drawing towards and contemplating the vast sea of beauty, he will create many fair and noble thoughts and notions in boundless love of wisdom ... and at last the vision is revealed to him of a single science, which is the science of beauty everywhere ... a nature which in the first place is everlasting, not growing and decaying, or waxing and waning.</p><p>— <i>Symposium</i></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed, the most striking parallel between the perspective given in <i>Symposium</i> and the Christian worldview is the nature of the Form of the Good, which Plato describes as eternal, perfect, and the source of all beauty and truth.</p><blockquote><p>He who from these ascending under the influence of true love, begins to perceive that beauty is not far from the end. And the true order of going, or being led by another, to the things of love, is to begin from the beauties of earth and mount upwards ... from one going on to two... from two to all fair forms... from fair forms to fair practices ... from fair practices to fair notions ... until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty, and at last knows what the essense of beauty is. This, my dear ... is that life above all others which man should live, in contemplation of the beauty absolute; a beauty which if you once beheld now entrances you.</p><p>— <i>Symposium</i></p></blockquote><p>This is unmistakably close to the biblical concept of God as the ultimate Good—unchanging, the giver of all that is true and beautiful. Just as Plato envisions the lover who reaches the highest stage becoming “the friend of God and immortal,” Christianity promises eternal life through divine love. This suggests that <i>Eros</i>, far from being merely a reflection of divine love, is in fact the very means by which the soul approaches God. As Jesus said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.</p><p>— Matthew 22:37 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<p>And as St. Augustine confesses,</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>You move us to delight in praising You; for You have made us for Yourself, and our hearts are restless until they rest in You.</p><p>— <i>Confessions</i>, Book I, Chapter 1</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For wherever the soul of man turns itself, unless towards You, it is affixed to sorrows, yea, though it is affixed to beauteous things without You and without itself. And yet they were not unless they were from You.</p><p>— <i>Confessions</i>, Book IV, Chapter 10</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>One may interpret <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> as demonstrating the destructiveness of <i>Eros</i>. However, in Plato's framework, Romeo and Juliet’s tragedy is not simply that they followed <i>Eros</i> too far, but that they did not follow it far enough. Had they transcended their earthly passion into a deeper, wiser love—one that transformed suffering into something meaningful rather than merely inevitable—they might have found salvation rather than destruction.</p>\n\n<p>Plato’s insights into love as self-sacrificial, unifying, and transformative not only anticipate Christian theology but offer a philosophical framework for understanding the deepest human longing. This is a book that speaks to the timeless ache of the soul—the desire to love and be loved, not just in a temporary sense, but in a way that leads to the eternal.</p>",

    "contents": "<p>It is often assumed that faith is synonymous with irrationality—an abandonment of reason, logic, and evidence. And in conversations with skeptics, the charge is frequently leveled that religious belief is a blind leap unsupported by any objective grounding. The challenge goes like this: \"Try applying your faith-based reasoning to any other part of life, and it collapses. You wouldn't cross the street on 'faith' alone—you'd look both ways. So why suspend that standard when it comes to religion?\"</p>\n\n<p>On the surface, this seems like a powerful critique. But upon closer examination, it's built on a profound misunderstanding—not just of religion, but of what faith actually is, and how often we all, including skeptics, use it.</p>\n\n<h3>Faith in the Everyday</h3>\n\n<p>The dissenter claims, \"To make unsubstantiated assumptions in any other area of your life would result in failure.\" But is that true? Let's start with something simple: love. Can you prove you love someone by empirical means alone? Can you prove you are loved back—down to the molecular level? If your partner smiled at you today, do you call that an objective sign of love? Maybe. But is it possible to imagine someone smiling while hiding deceit? Of course. The act is objective, the meaning is not.</p>\n\n<p>Love, hope, forgiveness—these are not objectively measurable phenomena. They are deeply subjective experiences. And yet, they form the very core of what it means to live a good and meaningful life. To reduce them to cold calculus or neural firings is to strip them of their essence.</p>\n\n<p>One may wonder: \"Would you love your spouse if they showed no objective signs of affection?\" But, in reality, the question is flawed. It presumes love is primarily transactional. That its validity depends on measurable returns. But to love someone is not to tally what you can extract from them. True love sees the other as an end in themselves—not a means to your own gratification. This mirrors the love that God has for humanity—not based on what we can offer Him, but on who we are.</p>\n\n<h3>The Illusion of Pure Objectivity</h3>\n\n<p>Perhaps the greatest irony in this discussion is that those who reject religious faith often do so on the grounds of wanting only what is \"objectively verifiable.\" But this, too, is a kind of faith—a belief that human reason and empirical methods are capable of accessing the ultimate truth of reality. That the world exists independent of the mind. That our senses can be trusted. None of these are provable beyond doubt.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, as Descartes showed, even the very existence of the external world cannot be proven. All we can truly know is that we are thinking beings. Everything else is inference. To live is to trust—trust that the floor will hold you up when you get out of bed, that your memories are real, that the world won’t dissolve behind your back. We don’t think twice about it, but we live by <em>faith</em> every day.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.</p><p>— Psalm 20:7 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<h3>When Reason Becomes an Idol</h3>\n\n<p>And here's the deeper danger: when we elevate reason and empiricism above all else, we don’t eliminate faith—we simply reassign it. But now it's faith in our own limited faculties. We start trusting not in God, but in the creations of our own minds: methods, models, scientific paradigms. When reason becomes the final authority, it stops being a tool and becomes an idol. And like all idols, it eventually collapses under the weight of what it was never meant to bear.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>This is what the Lord says: “Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who draws strength from mere flesh and whose heart turns away from the Lord.”</p><p>— Jeremiah 17:5 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<p>When we idolize our intellect, we are doing exactly what Isaiah warned against: bowing down to the work of our own hands, and our own minds.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>All who make idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. Those who would speak up for them are blind; they are ignorant, to their own shame. Who shapes a god and casts an idol, which can profit nothing?... No one stops to think, no one has the knowledge or understanding to say... ‘Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?’</p><p>— Isaiah 44:9-10, 19-20 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<p>Paul echoes this very idea when he says that even the most brilliant worldly wisdom is utter foolishness before God:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness”; and again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.”</p><p>— 1 Corinthians 3:19–20 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Faith as Foundation, Not Escape</h3>\n\n<p>Christianity does not demonize reason. On the contrary, it prizes wisdom, logic, and discernment. But it does not worship them. The Church has always taught that reason is good, but it is not God. It is not the foundation of all things. It is a lamp, not the light itself.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods.</p><p>— Psalm 40:4 (NIV)</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Christian claim is not that you must abandon thought to believe. It is that <em>belief comes first</em>, and understanding flows from it. Faith is not the opposite of reason—it is the prerequisite for its fullest expression. For it is only through faith that we recognize that there is something beyond ourselves, beyond our senses, beyond our categories.</p>\n\n<p>So the question is not <em>whether</em> you have faith. You do. Everyone does. The real question is: <strong>What is the object of your faith?</strong> Is it science? Power? Yourself? Or is it the One who made all of it?</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>“For understanding is the reward of faith. Therefore, do not seek to understand in order to believe, but believe so that you may understand.”</p><p>— St. Augustine, Tractate 29:6 (on John 7:14–18)</p></blockquote>",

    "contents": "<p><strong>\"If God exists, I want nothing to do with Him.\"</strong> That’s the heart cry of a growing number of people who, when faced with the moral dilemmas found in Scripture—slavery, genocide, natural disasters—reject not just Christianity, but the very idea of God Himself. And honestly? I understand where they’re coming from. They point to the God of the Bible and ask, how could an all-loving, all-powerful being do <i>this</i>? Command the slaughter of people? Let children suffer? Allow slavery?</p>\n\n<p>But I want to pause and flip the conversation. Because I believe the very moral outrage you feel is not evidence <i>against</i> God. It's evidence <strong>for</strong> Him.</p>\n\n<h3>The Objection: A Morally Repugnant God</h3>\n<p>Critics point to passages in Scripture where God appears to sanction morally dubious acts. Take the story of the flood:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth... So the LORD said, <strong>I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created.</strong></p><p>— Genesis 6:5a,7a (NIV)</blockquote>\n<p>Or Abraham and Isaac:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Then God said, \"Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.\"</p><p>— Genesis 22:2 (NIV)</blockquote>\n<p>Or New Testament passages like:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.</p><p>— Ephesians 6:5 (NIV)</blockquote>\n<p>To the modern reader, this can sound repulsive. It offends our moral intuitions. But that raises a powerful question: <strong>Where did you get those moral intuitions?</strong></p>\n\n<h3>The Hidden Premise: A Moral Standard</h3>\n<p>If you’re outraged by the idea of slavery, suffering, or injustice, then you are presupposing some moral standard by which you judge God—and that standard cannot come from nature itself. If you believe we are just evolved animals, clumps of carbon and neural networks firing off chemicals, then what exactly is your basis for human rights? For moral indignation?</p>\n<p>Why is slavery wrong? Why is genocide wrong? Why do children <i>deserve</i> to live? Why do humans have inherent dignity?</p>\n<p>You <strong>feel</strong> that they do, but those feelings mean nothing unless there's a deeper moral reality they’re pointing to. And they are:</p><blockquote><p> So God created mankind in his own image,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the image of God he created them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;male and female he created them.</p><p>— Genesis 1:27 (NIV)</blockquote><p>It is <i>the Christian worldview</i> that says we are created in the image of God, endowed with dignity, value, and purpose. Yet many reject the God who gives that worldview coherence while fully realizing its effects.</p>\n\n<h3>God, Slavery, and Historical Context</h3>\n<p>Let’s also talk about the slavery objection directly. Many critics cite verses like Ephesians 6:5 or Colossians 3:22. But they often overlook both context and language. The Greek word <i>doulos</i> (δοῦλος) can mean servant, bond-servant, or slave, and its interpretation depends on historical and cultural background.</p>\n<p>The slavery of the ancient Near East was not identical to the race-based, dehumanizing chattel slavery of American history. In many cases, it was more akin to indentured servitude, a system for debt repayment, with legal protections and the possibility of freedom. Moreover, Paul does not command slavery; he addresses people within an existing social system, encouraging ethical treatment on both sides.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven.</p><p>— Colossians 4:1 (NIV)</blockquote>\n<p>It’s also worth noting the subversive edge of Christian teaching in a world where slavery was the norm. The gospel declared slave and free as equal heirs of the kingdom:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</p><p>— Galatians 3:28 (NIV)</blockquote>\n<p>Christianity sowed the seeds that would eventually undermine slavery entirely, leading abolitionists like Martin Luther King Jr. to fight against it <i>because</i> of their faith—not in spite of it.</p>\n\n<h3>Why Blame God for Free Will?</h3>\n<p>Some argue that God commands atrocities. But we need to separate what God <strong>permits</strong> from what God <strong>commands</strong>. Often, people cite instances of moral evil—war, murder, abuse—and lay the blame at God's feet. Yet human free will is central to Christian teaching. God does not force obedience; He allows us to choose.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve... But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD.</p><p>— Joshua 24:15 (NIV)</blockquote>\n<p>If God were to override human will every time someone was about to commit an atrocity, we would not be free at all, and thus true love would not exist. And if He never intervened, we’d accuse Him of being absent. Either way, we set the standard and then blame God for not conforming to it.</p>\n\n<h3>The Problem of Evil Proves the Problem of Atheism</h3>\n<p>If evil exists, then good exists. If good exists, then there must be some objective moral law. And if there’s an objective moral law, there must be a moral Lawgiver. Otherwise, what you call evil is just personal preference—your brain chemistry reacting negatively to stimuli. That doesn’t justify righteous anger or demands for justice. But Christianity does. Here’s what I see: the very outrage many feel when reading the supposed “immoral” acts of God in the Bible is not evidence against God, but evidence for Him. You feel these things because you were made to feel them. The human heart is wired to seek justice, beauty, truth, and love. And that hunger doesn’t come from nowhere.</p><p>Your longing for justice, your recoil at slavery, your tears for the suffering—all of it testifies to a deeper truth. That something is wrong with the world. And something must make it right. You say you wouldn’t want anything to do with God if He exists. But your very rejection reveals that you <i>believe</i> He does. You reject Him not like someone rejecting an idea, but like someone angry at a person—like someone who <i>knows</i> there’s Someone on the other side.</p><blockquote><p>For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.</p><p>— Romans 1:20 (NIV)</blockquote><h3>The Invitation</h3>\n<p>God can seem distant and offensive when filtered only through difficult verses or historical abuses. But you can see Him. Not just in the sky, or the stars, or the logic of morality—but in the love that makes you cry when it’s absent. In the pain that demands meaning. In the soul that aches for more.</p>\n<p>If you want to know if God is real—look. But don’t just look for evidence. Look with a heart willing to see.</p><blockquote><p>The heavens declare the glory of God; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the skies proclaim the work of his hands. <br />Day after day they pour forth speech;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night after night they reveal knowledge.<br />They have no speech, they use no words;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no sound is heard from them.<br />Yet their voice goes out into all the earth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their words to the ends of the world.</p><p>— Psalm 19:1-4a (NIV)</blockquote>",    "image": [],

    "contents": "<p><strong>A follow-up to <a href='/writing/unanswered-questions-of-metaphysics-remain-unanswerable'>Unanswered Questions of Metaphysics Remain Unanswerable</a>:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In <em>Meditations on First Philosophy</em>, René Descartes writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So serious are the doubts [of our reality] … that I can neither put them out of my mind nor see any way of resolving them … I will suppose then that everything I see is spurious … my memory tells me lies [i.e. reconstructive memory] … I have no senses … nothing suggests itself … Thinking? At least I have discovered it – thought; this alone is inseparable from me. I am, I exist – that is certain … I know for certain both that I exist and at the same time that all images could be mere dreams … Yet I certainly seem to see, to hear, and to be warmed.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Descartes elaborates further:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If I look out of the window and see men crossing the square … I normally say that I see the men themselves … Yet do I see any more than hats and coats which could conceal automations? I judge that they are men. And so something which I thought I was seeing with my eyes is in fact grasped solely by the faculty of judgement which is in my mind.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Considering the example of atoms again, we normally say that atoms exist for a fact. However, we do not observe noumena, but rather <strong>phenomena</strong>, such as the way light refracts, how substances interact chemically, or how objects appear at the microscopic level. We then judge that atoms exist. Atomic theory, then, is constructed by the mind based on the information available to us. Just as with Descartes’ discussion on men, the existence of atoms is not as obvious as it seems; it is grasped by the mind through <strong>judgement</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Descartes argues that all ideas must have a cause. For example, we have the idea of atoms because of how we interpret physical phenomena. So how could we have the ideas of <em>perfection</em> or <em>infinity</em> when we are imperfect, finite beings? The only possible explanation is that such ideas proceeded from something which is truly perfect and infinite.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>It is true that I have the idea of substance [i.e. atoms] in me in virtue of the fact that I am a substance [i.e. made of atoms]; but this would not account for my having the idea of an infinite substance, when I am finite, unless this idea proceeded from some substance which really was infinite ... For how could I understand that I doubted or desired - that is, lacked something - and that I was not wholly perfect, unless there were in me some idea of a more perfect being which enabled me to recognize my own defects by comparison? … And indeed it is no surprise that God, in creating me, should have placed this idea in me to be, as it were, the mark of the craftsman stamped on his work ... So from what has been said it must be concluded that God necessarily exists … It does not matter that I do not grasp the infinite, or that there are countless additional attributes of God which I cannot in any way grasp, and perhaps cannot even reach in my thought; for it is in the nature of the infinite not to be grasped by a finite being like myself ... This is enough to make the idea that I have of God the truest and most clear and distinct of all my ideas.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Integrating this into our previous discussion, Descartes argues:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Whenever my preconceived belief in the supreme power of God comes to mind, I cannot but admit that it would be easy for him, if he so desired, to bring it about that I go wrong even in those matters which I think I see utterly clearly with my mind's eye ... it is clear to me that the ideas in me are like images [i.e. phenomena] which can easily fall short of the perfection of the things from which they are taken [i.e. noumena], but which cannot contain anything greater or more perfect ... I notice that the things which I perceive clearly and distinctly in them are very few in number ... so there remains only the idea of God ... by the word \"God\" I understand a substance that is infinite, eternal, immutable, independent, supremely intelligent, supremely powerful, and which created both myself and everything else that exists.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Descartes’ work shows us that while our grasp of reality is incomplete, the mind is capable of recognizing its own limitations and, in doing so, <strong>points toward the existence of something greater</strong>. He not only questions the certainty of the physical world but also leaves us with a deeper appreciation for the mysteries of existence that lie beyond the reach of human judgement.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.</p><p>— Romans 1:20 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This awareness—that we judge, perceive, and reach toward truth not through our senses but through a rational faculty <em>stamped with the idea of the infinite</em>—finds resonance in Romans 1:20. Though Descartes questions the certainty of the physical world, he affirms that even in our epistemic limits, the mind discerns marks of its Maker. It is precisely in recognizing what we cannot know with clarity that we are drawn toward what transcends us—toward the source of all clarity, all being, and all truth.</p>",

    "contents": "<p>From a debate on transcendental realism v. empiricism: </p><p>According to <strong>Immanuel Kant’s transcendental realism</strong>, our experience of reality is not a direct encounter with the <em>noumena</em> (things as they truly are) but rather with <em>phenomena</em> (how things appear to us). In Kant’s framework, the mind actively organizes and interprets noumenal information through its intrinsic faculties—such as the categories of space and time—in order to construct the phenomenal world we perceive.</p>\n\n<p>Shackelford asserts that Kant’s theory of noumena introduces a contradiction: how can Kant claim we have no knowledge of noumena while simultaneously asserting that it exists? However, the fact that we cannot access or know the noumenal does not invalidate its existence. This can be illustrated by the example of a locked safe: we may not have the key to unlock its contents, but we still recognize that the safe exists and likely contains something. Similarly, the noumenal realm remains inaccessible not because it is non-existent, but because human cognition is fundamentally incapable of reaching it. The acknowledgment of its existence is precisely what sets the limits of our understanding.</p>\n\n<p>In Shackelford’s discussion of atoms, he argues that proving their existence is easier than discovering them. Yet he overlooks a central issue: the atom, while empirically verified in the phenomenal world, cannot be definitively said to exist in the noumenal world. While empirical discoveries like atoms can be “proven” phenomenally, their existence outside human cognition remains unknowable. We cannot step outside our own minds to confirm their existence in the noumenal realm. Thus, the atom as we know it is a product of the mind’s structuring activity—<strong>a phenomenon</strong>, not an objective fact independent of consciousness.</p>\n\n<p>Drawing on quantum mechanics, the <strong>collapse of the wave function</strong> may serve to illustrate Kant’s metaphysics. The wave function describes a superposition of potential states, but the actual state of a particle is unknown until it is observed. The unmeasured state could be said to represent the particle’s noumenal essence. Once observation occurs, the wave function collapses and the particle assumes a determinate phenomenal state. Although the phenomenal state is accessible to us, the noumenal nature of the particle remains untouched. This analogy underscores Kant’s claim that reality as it is in itself remains forever beyond the limits of empirical observation.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, Shackelford places undue faith in empiricism as a means to answer metaphysical questions, claiming it offers certainty and permanence. On the contrary, our perception of the world is inherently limited. The existence of <em>things-in-themselves</em>—the noumena—remains beyond our cognitive grasp. This is reinforced by principles in quantum mechanics, where measurement reveals only the phenomenal, not the noumenal. Therefore, despite Shackelford’s critique, Kant’s transcendental realism remains a robust and accurate description of the limits of human knowledge.</p>",

    "contents": "<h3>Introduction</h3> <p>In the paper, <i>The Extended Mind</i>, Andy Clark and David Chalmers present their extended mind thesis. They begin the paper by asking “Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?” For many, it may seem intuitive to believe that the mind is entirely contained within the brain, and everything outside of one’s brain is outside of their mind. Using this notion of <strong>internalism</strong>, the mind may be considered an emergent property of the brain but is ultimately contained within the brain, and cognitive processes can only occur in the brain. However, <strong>externalists</strong> believe that the external environment also plays a role in cognition. In Clark and Chalmers’ extended mind thesis, they argue for <strong>active externalism</strong>, the idea that objects outside of one’s brain can be a part of the mind.</p> <p><strong>Active externalism</strong> asserts that the environment plays an active role in cognitive processes. That is, parts of the external world can function as cognitive processes if they play a similar role to that which would be recognized as cognitive if it occurred in the brain. Cognition is not confined within the boundaries of the individual and their physical brain, but it can extend into the external environment, incorporating tools, devices, or anything else. In cognitive science, this work broadens the understanding of what a cognitive process actually is, extending its definition beyond the traditional boundaries of the brain and the body. This view recognizes the significant role of external factors and modern technologies in cognitive tasks – it explains that tools and technologies are not merely aiding cognition, but that they are integral parts of it.</p> <h3>Examples</h3> <p>Clark and Chalmers use the example of mental rotation, arguing that imagining rotating objects on a computer screen, using cognitive processes of the mind, is no different than simply rotating the objects using processes of the computer, like in a photo-editing application. In this way, the computer can be considered part of the mind, and the processes that allow rotation on the computer can be considered cognitive.</p> <p>The first example that comes to mind for me is the use of the “Reminders” or “Calendar” app on a smartphone, but the following reasoning can also be applied to conventional to-do lists and calendars (and even language itself, but this is outside the scope of this paper). Traditionally, <strong>memory</strong> has been a cognitive process that happens internally within one’s brain. Without these apps (or analogous tools), one would have to rely exclusively on memory to keep track of dates, meetings, and important tasks. However, when someone enters a reminder into the app, they effectively offload a part of their memory onto an external device, allowing them to only require remembering to have their phone with them, reserving internal cognitive load for other things. When the time comes and the phone alerts the individual by triggering a notification, it works similarly to the memory recall process in the brain. In this way, the smartphone becomes an active participant in the cognitive processes of memory and recall, functioning as a part of the mind.</p> <p>I would take this argument a step further to say that <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> tools also function as a part of the mind. Professors may argue that, by using AI tools (like ChatGPT) to write essays, students are simply being lazy and aren’t really doing the work. In reality, this argument is rooted in societal tradition and these tools function to achieve the same outcomes that writing an essay in the traditional sense does. While a student may be less likely to comprehend the information within their internal mind, if one uses the lens of active externalism, the AI tool is a part of the student’s mind. The AI tool simply allows the student to offload internal cognition to the computer, reserving internal cognitive processes for other tasks. (There is much more to say about this, but that is outside the scope of this paper.)</p> <p>I would also argue that one’s mind not only extends beyond their own brain, but into the brains of others. For example, consider the role of the professor, and that of other students, in a learning environment. Here, cognition is a <strong>collaborative and social process</strong>. Using the lens of internalism, one would be forced to argue that the cognitive process of understanding is a process isolated within one’s physical brain. On the contrary, learning and understanding are often facilitated through interactions with others. When students engage in group discussions, projects, or study groups, they are essentially participating in distributed cognitive work. Each student brings their unique understanding, knowledge, and skills to the group. Through discussion and collaboration, these individual contributions are pooled together, leading to a richer and more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter than what any one student could achieve alone. For example, during a group discussion, one student may contribute key facts, another student may offer an insightful interpretation of these facts, and a third may draw connections to other relevant ideas. This collaborative process extends the cognitive capabilities of each individual, allowing them to achieve a level of understanding that transcends their individual capacities. Educators also play a crucial role in the cognitive processes of their students by facilitating learning. They provide support, guidance, and structure to the cognitive processes of students in order to help them learn more effectively. For example, an educator might break down a concept into more manageable parts, provide examples and analogies, ask guiding questions, or offer feedback that helps students refine their cognition. This enables students to engage with and understand concepts that might be beyond their immediate grasp if they were working independently.</p> <p>Active externalism can also be applied to the field of <strong>medicine</strong>, offering a fascinating perspective on the role of the physician. In medical practice, diagnostic tools like CT scanners and MRI machines serve as a part of a physician’s mind. These tools provide critical information that goes beyond the natural perceptual abilities of humans. They can reveal detailed internal structures of the body that are not visible to the naked eye, aiding in the diagnosis of conditions that would otherwise be inaccessible to a doctor’s cognition. In this way, CT’s and MRI’s serve as an extension of vision, allowing clinicians to “see” outside of the visible color spectrum and into the realms of high-energy x-ray wavelengths and detailed magnetic field variations, respectively. Moreover, these scans allow for a deeper cognitive understanding of the patient’s condition, and physicians can integrate this data with other knowledge to enable more accurate diagnoses and treatments. Essentially, these imaging technologies not only extend the physician’s perceptual capabilities but also augment their cognitive processes.</p> <p>In the same way that apps on the smartphone extend memory, <strong>electronic health records (EHRs)</strong> can also extend the memory and capabilities of healthcare professionals. They can provide a comprehensive and accessible repository of patient information including medical history, test results, and treatment information. EHRs allow providers to access vast amounts of data that would be impossible to retain in their internal memory, allowing their internal cognitive load to be focused on integrating the information, rather than memorizing it. The same reasoning can be applied to medical and scientific literature, online databases, and online forums, all of which act as external cognitive resources. These resources greatly extend the physician’s knowledge base beyond what any single individual could hope to memorize or comprehend on their own.</p> <h3>Strengths</h3> <p>Active externalism aligns well with the concept of <strong>haptic realism</strong>, proposed by Mazviita Chirimuuta. Haptic realism emphasizes the importance of interaction, physical contact, and purposeful exploration of the natural world in the process of perception. Chirimuuta argues that, just as touch requires contact and exploration to understand the external world, scientific thought informs us about the natural world through interactive qualities. She contrasts haptic realism with vision science, arguing that science should not rely on a passive reception of information, but an active, exploratory process that involves interaction with the environment. This idea of haptic realism aligns quite well with active externalism. Just as haptic realism emphasizes interaction and exploration in perception, active externalism emphasizes the use of external devices and technologies in cognition. These two ideas have a shared emphasis on interaction and integration with the external world as essential. Just as haptic realism asserts that touch and physical interaction are crucial for a deeper understanding of the world in science, active externalism suggests that external tools and technologies are not mere adjuncts to cognition but are integral components of it. Both of these perspectives challenge the traditional notion of passive reception in cognition and perception, suggesting a dynamic interplay between the individual and external world. In essence, both haptic realism and active externalism suggest a more expansive definition of cognition and understanding, one that transcends the boundaries of the human body and embraces the transformative potential of our interactions with the external environment.</p> <p>Active externalism also fits well with <strong>Eduardo Viveiros de Castro’s Amerindian Perspectivism</strong>. De Castro defines “nature” as what differentiates beings, “culture” as the universal aspect of different beings, and “supernatural” as the existence of beings beyond their natural form. Just as active externalism extends cognition beyond the realm of immediate sensory experiences, Amerindian supernaturalism presents a realm of individuality that goes beyond ordinary experiences, encompassing spiritual or mystical aspects of reality. In the context of Amerindian perspectivism, an individual’s internal cognition can be considered akin to “nature” or “culture” (or a blend of both). In this context, the supernatural could be paralleled with the extended cognitive realms that active externalism explores, where cognition is not just a product of the brain’s internal workings but is dynamically shaped by interactions with the external environment. Thus, both active externalism and Amerindian perspectivism challenge traditional views, suggesting an expanded understanding of cognition and perception. This reshapes how we might understand the mind not as an isolated entity, but as something deeply connected with, and responsive to, the broader environment.</p> <p>The idea of active externalism also pairs nicely with <strong>Ellen Clarke’s notion of biological individuality</strong>. Clarke argues that traditional views of biological individuality, often based on physical or genetic boundaries, may be inadequate or overly simplistic. She emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive approach to defining individuality, one that accounts for the complex and interconnected nature of life forms. Both Clarke’s notion of biological individuality and the concept of active externalism emphasize the importance of considering broader, interconnected systems, rather than restricting the focus to individual, isolated units. Both concepts highlight the emergent properties and capabilities that arise from interconnectedness, whether in biological networks, like a thriving ecosystem, or in collective minds, like a learning environment.</p> <h3>Weaknesses</h3> <p>While active externalism offers a compelling redefinition of cognition, it does have limitations, especially when considering its practical implications in our present society. Traditional societal views often delineate the mind and environment, which is likely rooted in longstanding tradition that privileges internal, individual cognition over external, distributed processes. Embracing active externalism on a wider level may be difficult due to deeply entrenched beliefs in the sanctity and exclusivity of the human mind. There may be skepticism towards active externalism fueled by a cultural and educational system that emphasizes individual achievement over collaboration. Further, this idea may be unsettling for some as it blurs the lines between self and non-self, but it is important to recognize that this theory does not dismiss the individual, but rather expands on what it is to be an individual.</p> <p>Overall, I believe that weaknesses attributed to active externalism are not inherent flaws in the theory itself but are reflections of our societal and cultural inclinations towards internalism. To fully appreciate the potential of active externalism, a paradigm shift in our understanding of cognition, which recognizes the integration of the mind, body, and environment in the cognitive process, is required.</p> <h3>References</h3> <p>Clark, A., & Chalmers, D.

    "contents": "<p>A reflection on <a href='https://philarchive.org/archive/FODSSO' target='_blank'><strong>J.A. Fodor's <i>Special Sciences</i></strong></a>:</p>  <p>In the paper, <i>Special Sciences</i>, J.A. Fodor argues that <strong>reductivism</strong> is too strong a constraint on the unity of science. He argues in favor of the weaker <strong>token physicalism</strong>, which preserves the desired consequences of reductivism while allowing for the unity of science.</p>  <p><strong>Reductivism</strong> (also known as <strong>reductionism</strong>) in science is the view that all special sciences (i.e. all sciences except physics) can be reduced to physics. That is, any event in the special sciences can be adequately explained by a physical event. It is often assumed, for example, that psychology can be reduced to physics via neurology, biology, biochemistry, and chemistry. Psychological events can be explained in terms of neurology, neurological events can be explained in terms of biology, and so on, all the way to physics. In reductivism, concepts from special sciences can be reduced in this manner via <strong>bridge laws</strong>, which are meant to express “identities.” For instance, consider x behavior (a psychological concept) and y pattern of neuronal activation in the brain (a neurological concept). In reductivism, a bridge law (written ‘x ↔ y’) would imply that x behavior is always and only caused by y pattern of neuronal activation, and that y pattern of neuronal activation always and only causes x behavior. This type of relation is known as a <strong>type-to-type correlation</strong>, a 1-to-1 match.</p>  <p><strong>Token physicalism</strong> in science is the view that all events that all sciences talk about are physical events. This interpretation is weaker than reductivism in that reductivism requires type-to-type correlation, whereas token physicalism does not. Consider the previous example of x behavior and y pattern of neuronal activation. In token physicalism, there does not need to exist the 1-to-1 match as was required in reductivism. Instead, for example, x behavior may be caused by a, b, or c patterns of neuronal activation, whether between individuals or within one. In our special sciences, there does not always exist a 1-to-1 match, especially in fields like psychology. The same behavior, emotion, or thought may result from a variety of different situations, each with a distinct pattern of neuronal activation. In such cases, the psychological concept can be explained in terms of neurology, but its entire essence (e.g. the emotion of happiness) cannot be captured with neurology alone. Along the same lines, Fodor mentions that economics cannot be reduced to physics, but that a wide range of physical phenomena could account for economic events. He explains that this provides support for token physicalism, rather than reductivism. In order to prove reductivism, rather than mere token physicalism, one would need to map all of the neuronal firing patterns or physical events to their corresponding psychological or economic events. However, even if this were possible, again, the entire essence of the psychological phenomenon would not be adequately captured.</p>  <p>Fodor mentions that there are two main reasons to believe that token physicalism is a more accurate representation of science than reductivism. First, token physicalism recognizes the inherent complexities and nuances present in the special sciences by allowing exceptions in the laws governing them. He argues that if one were to take the strict reductionist stance, it is challenging to account for minute physical deviations in the context of fields like psychology or economics. Second, the very existence of special sciences is a testament to their unique contributions to understanding the natural world. If everything could truly be reduced to physics, there would be no need for any of the special sciences, including psychology and economics. Ultimately, these fields offer explanations for the manifestations of a myriad of distinct physical events, and they exist because they offer insights that could not be fully appreciated in the context of physics. He continues by arguing that even if fields like psychology or economics could be reduced to mere physics, it is unlikely that the language of physics would be able to concisely account for observations in those fields.</p>  <p>Overall, Fodor prefers the weakest view, <strong>token physicalism</strong>, and argues that reductionists should really be token physicalists. He contends that a strict adherence to reductivism limits our understanding of reality, as it fails to account for the complexities inherent in the special sciences. While physics may lay the foundation for scientific inquiry, it is through the special sciences that we gain a fuller, more nuanced understanding of the natural world.</p>  <p>However, I am inclined toward a broader perspective that synthesizes <strong>Kant’s transcendental realism</strong> with <strong>Christian thought</strong>. Kant’s transcendental realism acknowledges that while we experience reality through the structures of our perception and cognition, there exists a noumenal realm beyond empirical observation—a realm that reductionism cannot fully capture. This perspective aligns with Christianity’s affirmation of a reality that transcends the physical, recognizing the existence of both material and spiritual dimensions.</p>  <p>An example that illustrates the limitations of both reductivism and token physicalism can be found in the study of <strong>human consciousness</strong>. While neuroscience can identify neural correlates of thought, emotion, and self-awareness, it cannot fully explain the subjective experience of being (i.e., <i>qualia</i>). Token physicalism acknowledges the complexity of these experiences by allowing for multiple neurological pathways to correspond with a given mental state, but it does not address why subjective experience exists at all. Kantian transcendentalism provides a richer framework by suggesting that consciousness itself is not just an emergent property of neural activity but a fundamental condition of knowledge, shaping how we interpret reality. Christianity further deepens this perspective by asserting that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of material processes but a reflection of the divine, rooted in the soul’s relationship with God. Together, these perspectives suggest that human experience cannot be fully understood through physical explanations alone; rather, it requires recognition of both the structures of human cognition and the existence of a transcendent order that imbues life with meaning and purpose. By integrating these perspectives, I argue that a truly comprehensive understanding of the world must go beyond token physicalism and incorporate not only the insights of the special sciences but also the recognition of transcendental and divine realities that give meaning to human experience.</p>",

    "contents": "<p><strong>An opinion on <a href='https://www.jstor.org/stable/24356006' target='_blank'><i>Tom Walker’s <i>Who Do We Treat First When Resources Are Scarce?</i></i></a></strong></p>\n\n<p>In this paper, Tom Walker explains that healthcare resources are limited, and difficult decisions must be made about who should receive treatment first. A common intuition suggests that we should prioritize those whose illnesses are not self-inflicted. However, Walker argues that if resources are sufficient, everyone should receive care, and his aim is to construct a principle for determining priority when resources are scarce. Initially, he presents a principle stating that if two people require the same resource, but only one is ill due to their own choices—assuming they had reasonable knowledge of the risks and did not take steps to mitigate them—then the other person should be treated first.</p>\n\n<p>However, this principle raises several ethical concerns. It does not account for whether the choice was truly voluntary, whether the individual had full autonomy, or whether they were in a position to fully understand the risks. Walker attempts to refine this principle by introducing the requirement that the person could have reasonably foreseen the consequences of their actions. Yet, even this revision does not fully resolve the issue, as it does not consider whether the individual had viable alternatives. Walker does present a final principle that further specifies that the person must have had reasonable alternatives and could have recognized a safer course of action. Even so, the principle remains problematic in its application. For example, firefighters who knowingly risk their lives in the line of duty could be deprioritized under such a framework, despite the fact that their actions are widely recognized as selfless and honorable. This suggests that the criteria for determining responsibility in healthcare decisions are far more complex than a simple distinction between voluntary and involuntary harm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fundamentally, I disagree with any framework that attempts to base medical treatment on judgments about whether a person’s illness is self-inflicted.</strong> First, from a practical standpoint, it is exceedingly difficult to determine the degree to which an individual is responsible for their condition. Many diseases and injuries involve complex interactions of genetic, environmental, and social factors, making personal responsibility a murky and often unfair criterion. Second, such a principle risks introducing moral judgments into medical practice, which could lead to a culture of blame and punishment—precisely the opposite of the compassionate, impartial care that medicine should provide. Biases, both conscious and unconscious, could further distort these decisions, leading to inequitable treatment. Moreover, mental health considerations must not be overlooked: many supposedly “self-inflicted” conditions, such as substance use disorders or complications from risky behaviors, are often driven by psychological, social, and economic factors that diminish true autonomy. A system that denies care based on perceived responsibility risks deepening existing disparities and further marginalizing vulnerable populations.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, while Walker’s attempt to establish a rational framework is understandable, it fails to account for the deeper moral imperative of medicine: to care for all people with dignity, irrespective of the circumstances that led to their suffering. In triage situations, the primary considerations should be medical urgency and the ability to benefit from treatment, not subjective judgments of merit. If two patients are equally in need, choosing the one closest or using random selection ensures fairness while upholding the fundamental principle that all human lives are of equal worth. Healthcare should not be seen as a privilege reserved for those deemed \"deserving\" based on past choices but as a basic human right, reflective of the intrinsic dignity of every individual.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>So God created mankind in his own image,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the image of God he created them;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;male and female he created them.</p><p>— Genesis 1:27 (NIV)</p></blockquote>",

    "title": "The Doctrine of Double Effect",
    "date": "March 14, 2023",
    "name": "Spencer Wozniak",
    "topic": "Bioethics",
    "contents": "<p><strong>In Christian moral reasoning, one may never intentionally do evil, even for the sake of achieving a good outcome.</strong> This distinction between intention and consequence lies at the heart of the Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE), a moral framework that seeks to navigate situations where a single action has both positive and negative consequences. The DDE does not offer a license to commit evil for the sake of good, but rather a structured means of discerning whether an action that results in harm can still be morally permissible—provided the harm is neither the agent’s goal nor the means to that goal.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Why not say—as some slanderously claim that we say—“Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is just!</p><p>— Romans 3:8 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>St. Thomas Aquinas offers the clearest foundation for this doctrine when he argues that it is legitimate to preserve one’s own life, even if doing so unintentionally results in the death of an aggressor. For Aquinas, the moral weight of the act depends not on the outcome alone, but on the agent’s intention and the proportionality between means and ends. This theological insight—that a single act may be morally permissible if the evil effect is neither intended nor the cause of the good effect—forms the basis of what later came to be known as the Doctrine of Double Effect.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Nothing hinders one act from having two effects, only one of which is intended, while the other is beside the <a href='intention' target='_blank'>intention</a>, since this is <a href='' target='_blank'>accidental</a> as explained above. Accordingly the act of self-defense may have two effects, one is the saving of one's life, the other is the slaying of the aggressor. Therefore this act, since one's <a href='intention' target='_blank'>intention</a> is to save one's own life, is not unlawful, seeing that it is natural to everything to keep itself in \"being,\" as far as possible. And yet, though proceeding from a <a href='intention' target='_blank'>good intention</a>, an act may be rendered unlawful, if it be out of proportion to the end.</p><p>— Summa Theologiae II–II, Question 64, Article 7</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Contemporary articulations of the DDE typically outline four conditions for moral permissibility:</p><ol><li>The act itself must be morally good or neutral.</li> <li>The bad effect must not be the means to the good effect.</li> <li>The bad effect may be foreseen but not intended.</li> <li>There must be a proportionately grave reason for permitting the bad effect.</li></ol> These conditions echo Aquinas’ reasoning, while giving it practical structure for modern ethical analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike consequentialist theories, which evaluate actions solely by their outcomes, the DDE is rooted in a moral absolutism that affirms the existence of intrinsic right and wrong. While this framework may appear rigid to some, it protects against the moral relativism that can arise when only outcomes matter. The DDE offers a way to remain faithful to moral principles even when faced with tragic choices—affirming that one must always intend the good, never the evil, and that evil may only be tolerated when it is neither sought nor used as a means.</p>\n\n<p>The DDE is particularly relevant in <strong>medical ethics</strong>, where actions often carry morally weighty consequences. A frequently cited application is the use of high-dose opioids in palliative care. When administered with the primary intent of relieving pain in terminally ill patients, any potential hastening of death is considered a foreseen but unintended effect. This practice is morally permissible under the DDE, as the physician’s goal is not death, but comfort—a goal that aligns both with medical ethics and with Christian compassion. Here, the DDE helps safeguard against both nihilistic fatalism and utilitarian overreach by maintaining a firm boundary between intention and effect.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the DDE resonates with the core principles of biomedical ethics—<strong>beneficence</strong> and <strong>non-maleficence</strong> in particular—as it requires careful moral discernment about potential goods and harms. It aligns with the Christian imperative to do good and avoid evil, while acknowledging the tragic complexities of real-life ethical decisions. By providing a principled yet flexible structure, the DDE helps preserve the integrity of moral action, especially in situations where any choice involves suffering.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the doctrine is not without its challenges. Determining intention is not always clear-cut, and there is always the danger of misusing the DDE to justify morally questionable actions. Its emphasis on subjective intention, if not properly understood, can open the door to rationalization rather than genuine discernment. But even here, the DDE serves not as a loophole, but as a call to deeper moral clarity—a way of holding intention, consequence, and character in balance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ultimately, the Doctrine of Double Effect remains a vital tool in Christian ethics and moral philosophy more broadly.</strong> By drawing a firm line between intending harm and merely permitting it, the DDE provides a way of remaining faithful to Romans 3:8—refusing to do evil that good may come—while also engaging the complexity of real moral life. It reflects both reason and compassion, and in doing so, honors the integrity of the human person and the sanctity of life, even in the most difficult of circumstances.</p>",

    "contents": "<p>A reflection on <a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470510544.ch17' target='_blank'>James Hughes' <i>Buddhist Bioethics</i><strong>: </strong></a></p><p>The discussion of Buddhist bioethics highlights the complexity of ethical traditions that, while distinct from Western frameworks, nonetheless resonate with key moral concerns found in broader philosophical and theological discourse. One of the most striking aspects of Buddhist bioethics is its reliance on a <a href='https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/' target='_blank'><strong>teleological virtue ethics</strong></a>, in which moral reasoning is grounded in the pursuit of enlightenment rather than strict <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontology' target='_blank'><strong>deontological obligations</strong></a> or purely <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism' target='_blank'><strong>consequentialist</strong></a> outcomes. This emphasis on cultivating moral virtue and intentionality is compelling, particularly in the context of medical ethics, where actions often carry both positive and negative consequences. The Buddhist notion that morality is grounded in a natural law of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma#In_Buddhism' target='_blank'><strong>karmic causality</strong></a> offers an intriguing parallel to Christian ethical teachings, which emphasize a moral order inscribed into creation.</p>\n\n<p>A key area of overlap between Buddhist and Christian ethics is the centrality of <strong>compassion</strong>. In Buddhist thought, the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva' target='_blank'><strong>bodhisattva</strong></a> embodies selfless compassion, dedicating themselves to alleviating suffering through skillful means. This idea resonates with the Christian ethic of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape' target='_blank'><strong>agape</strong></a>, or self-giving love, which is foundational to Christian moral reasoning. The Christian commitment to healing and care for the sick, as seen in the works of Jesus and the ethical teachings of the Church, closely aligns with Buddhist principles of non-maleficence and beneficence.</p>\n\n<p>However, the two traditions diverge in their conceptions of self. Christianity holds that human beings are created in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_of_God' target='_blank'><strong>the image of God</strong></a>, endowed with an intrinsic dignity that remains constant, whereas Buddhist ethics is shaped by the doctrine of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatt%C4%81' target='_blank'><strong>anattā</strong></a> (no-self), which suggests that personal identity is an illusion. This divergence between Buddhist and Christian ethics emerges in discussions of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. Buddhism’s emphasis on the transitory nature of existence and its rejection of attachment to the physical body sometimes leads to a more permissive stance. By contrast, Christian ethics upholds the intrinsic value of each person’s life, regardless of suffering, and insists that true compassion lies not in hastening death but in accompanying the dying with care and dignity.</p><blockquote><p>So God created mankind in his own image,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the image of God he created them;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;male and female he created them.</p><p>— Genesis 1:27 (NIV)</p></blockquote><p>Another key area of consideration is healthcare access and justice. The Buddhist perspective, as discussed in the text, tends to emphasize compassion and care for the poor, yet it does not provide a clear doctrinal basis for the practice. In contrast, Christian ethics strongly affirms that healthcare is a fundamental human right, as the belief that all human beings are created in God’s image compels an ethical commitment to justice and the preferential option for the poor. As seen in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan' target='_blank'><strong>the parable of the Good Samaritan</strong></a>, Christian teachings emphasize the moral duty to care for the most vulnerable, advocating for healthcare systems that prioritize need rather than ability to pay. Either way, both Buddhist and Christian perspectives contrast with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer-driven_healthcare' target='_blank'><strong>market-driven healthcare models</strong></a> that allocate resources based on wealth rather than moral urgency.</p><blockquote><p> Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead … a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.  He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.’ … Go and do likewise.”</p><p>— Luke 10:30,33-35,37 (NIV)</p></blockquote><p>Despite their differences, Buddhist and Christian ethics share an appreciation for moral intentionality, compassion, and the rejection of purely utilitarian calculations. Both traditions recognize that ethical decision-making cannot be reduced to rigid rules alone but must account for the complexities of human suffering and the call to alleviate it. While each tradition has its own foundational principles, both contribute to a broader understanding of what it means to act ethically in the face of difficult choices, making them invaluable for anyone seeking to navigate the complexities of bioethical reasoning with intellectual depth and moral clarity.</p>",
