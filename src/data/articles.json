    "contents": "<p><strong>A follow-up to <a href='/writing/unanswered-questions-of-metaphysics-remain-unanswerable'>Unanswered Questions of Metaphysics Remain Unanswerable</a>:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In <em>Meditations on First Philosophy</em>, René Descartes writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So serious are the doubts [of our reality] … that I can neither put them out of my mind nor see any way of resolving them … I will suppose then that everything I see is spurious … my memory tells me lies [i.e. reconstructive memory] … I have no senses … nothing suggests itself … Thinking? At least I have discovered it – thought; this alone is inseparable from me. I am, I exist – that is certain … I know for certain both that I exist and at the same time that all images could be mere dreams … Yet I certainly seem to see, to hear, and to be warmed.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Descartes elaborates further:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If I look out of the window and see men crossing the square … I normally say that I see the men themselves … Yet do I see any more than hats and coats which could conceal automations? I judge that they are men. And so something which I thought I was seeing with my eyes is in fact grasped solely by the faculty of judgement which is in my mind.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Considering the example of atoms again, we normally say that atoms exist for a fact. However, we do not observe noumena, but rather <strong>phenomena</strong>, such as the way light refracts, how substances interact chemically, or how objects appear at the microscopic level. We then judge that atoms exist. Atomic theory, then, is constructed by the mind based on the information available to us. Just as with Descartes’ discussion on men, the existence of atoms is not as obvious as it seems; it is grasped by the mind through <strong>judgement</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Descartes argues that all ideas must have a cause. For example, we have the idea of atoms because of how we interpret physical phenomena. So how could we have the ideas of <em>perfection</em> or <em>infinity</em> when we are imperfect, finite beings? The only possible explanation is that such ideas proceeded from something which is truly perfect and infinite.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>It is true that I have the idea of substance [i.e. atoms] in me in virtue of the fact that I am a substance [i.e. made of atoms]; but this would not account for my having the idea of an infinite substance, when I am finite, unless this idea proceeded from some substance which really was infinite ... For how could I understand that I doubted or desired - that is, lacked something - and that I was not wholly perfect, unless there were in me some idea of a more perfect being which enabled me to recognize my own defects by comparison? … And indeed it is no surprise that God, in creating me, should have placed this idea in me to be, as it were, the mark of the craftsman stamped on his work ... So from what has been said it must be concluded that God necessarily exists … It does not matter that I do not grasp the infinite, or that there are countless additional attributes of God which I cannot in any way grasp, and perhaps cannot even reach in my thought; for it is in the nature of the infinite not to be grasped by a finite being like myself ... This is enough to make the idea that I have of God the truest and most clear and distinct of all my ideas.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Integrating this into our previous discussion, Descartes argues:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Whenever my preconceived belief in the supreme power of God comes to mind, I cannot but admit that it would be easy for him, if he so desired, to bring it about that I go wrong even in those matters which I think I see utterly clearly with my mind's eye ... it is clear to me that the ideas in me are like images [i.e. phenomena] which can easily fall short of the perfection of the things from which they are taken [i.e. noumena], but which cannot contain anything greater or more perfect ... I notice that the things which I perceive clearly and distinctly in them are very few in number ... so there remains only the idea of God ... by the word \"God\" I understand a substance that is infinite, eternal, immutable, independent, supremely intelligent, supremely powerful, and which created both myself and everything else that exists.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Descartes’ work shows us that while our grasp of reality is incomplete, the mind is capable of recognizing its own limitations and, in doing so, <strong>points toward the existence of something greater</strong>. He not only questions the certainty of the physical world but also leaves us with a deeper appreciation for the mysteries of existence that lie beyond the reach of human judgement.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.</p><p>— Romans 1:20 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This awareness—that we judge, perceive, and reach toward truth not through our senses but through a rational faculty <em>stamped with the idea of the infinite</em>—finds resonance in Romans 1:20. Though Descartes questions the certainty of the physical world, he affirms that even in our epistemic limits, the mind discerns marks of its Maker. It is precisely in recognizing what we cannot know with clarity that we are drawn toward what transcends us—toward the source of all clarity, all being, and all truth.</p>",

    "contents": "<p>From a debate on transcendental realism v. empiricism: </p><p>According to <strong>Immanuel Kant’s transcendental realism</strong>, our experience of reality is not a direct encounter with the <em>noumena</em> (things as they truly are) but rather with <em>phenomena</em> (how things appear to us). In Kant’s framework, the mind actively organizes and interprets noumenal information through its intrinsic faculties—such as the categories of space and time—in order to construct the phenomenal world we perceive.</p>\n\n<p>Shackelford asserts that Kant’s theory of noumena introduces a contradiction: how can Kant claim we have no knowledge of noumena while simultaneously asserting that it exists? However, the fact that we cannot access or know the noumenal does not invalidate its existence. This can be illustrated by the example of a locked safe: we may not have the key to unlock its contents, but we still recognize that the safe exists and likely contains something. Similarly, the noumenal realm remains inaccessible not because it is non-existent, but because human cognition is fundamentally incapable of reaching it. The acknowledgment of its existence is precisely what sets the limits of our understanding.</p>\n\n<p>In Shackelford’s discussion of atoms, he argues that proving their existence is easier than discovering them. Yet he overlooks a central issue: the atom, while empirically verified in the phenomenal world, cannot be definitively said to exist in the noumenal world. While empirical discoveries like atoms can be “proven” phenomenally, their existence outside human cognition remains unknowable. We cannot step outside our own minds to confirm their existence in the noumenal realm. Thus, the atom as we know it is a product of the mind’s structuring activity—<strong>a phenomenon</strong>, not an objective fact independent of consciousness.</p>\n\n<p>Drawing on quantum mechanics, the <strong>collapse of the wave function</strong> may serve to illustrate Kant’s metaphysics. The wave function describes a superposition of potential states, but the actual state of a particle is unknown until it is observed. The unmeasured state could be said to represent the particle’s noumenal essence. Once observation occurs, the wave function collapses and the particle assumes a determinate phenomenal state. Although the phenomenal state is accessible to us, the noumenal nature of the particle remains untouched. This analogy underscores Kant’s claim that reality as it is in itself remains forever beyond the limits of empirical observation.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, Shackelford places undue faith in empiricism as a means to answer metaphysical questions, claiming it offers certainty and permanence. On the contrary, our perception of the world is inherently limited. The existence of <em>things-in-themselves</em>—the noumena—remains beyond our cognitive grasp. This is reinforced by principles in quantum mechanics, where measurement reveals only the phenomenal, not the noumenal. Therefore, despite Shackelford’s critique, Kant’s transcendental realism remains a robust and accurate description of the limits of human knowledge.</p>",

    "contents": "<h3>Introduction</h3> <p>In the paper, <i>The Extended Mind</i>, Andy Clark and David Chalmers present their extended mind thesis. They begin the paper by asking “Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?” For many, it may seem intuitive to believe that the mind is entirely contained within the brain, and everything outside of one’s brain is outside of their mind. Using this notion of <strong>internalism</strong>, the mind may be considered an emergent property of the brain but is ultimately contained within the brain, and cognitive processes can only occur in the brain. However, <strong>externalists</strong> believe that the external environment also plays a role in cognition. In Clark and Chalmers’ extended mind thesis, they argue for <strong>active externalism</strong>, the idea that objects outside of one’s brain can be a part of the mind.</p> <p><strong>Active externalism</strong> asserts that the environment plays an active role in cognitive processes. That is, parts of the external world can function as cognitive processes if they play a similar role to that which would be recognized as cognitive if it occurred in the brain. Cognition is not confined within the boundaries of the individual and their physical brain, but it can extend into the external environment, incorporating tools, devices, or anything else. In cognitive science, this work broadens the understanding of what a cognitive process actually is, extending its definition beyond the traditional boundaries of the brain and the body. This view recognizes the significant role of external factors and modern technologies in cognitive tasks – it explains that tools and technologies are not merely aiding cognition, but that they are integral parts of it.</p> <h3>Examples</h3> <p>Clark and Chalmers use the example of mental rotation, arguing that imagining rotating objects on a computer screen, using cognitive processes of the mind, is no different than simply rotating the objects using processes of the computer, like in a photo-editing application. In this way, the computer can be considered part of the mind, and the processes that allow rotation on the computer can be considered cognitive.</p> <p>The first example that comes to mind for me is the use of the “Reminders” or “Calendar” app on a smartphone, but the following reasoning can also be applied to conventional to-do lists and calendars (and even language itself, but this is outside the scope of this paper). Traditionally, <strong>memory</strong> has been a cognitive process that happens internally within one’s brain. Without these apps (or analogous tools), one would have to rely exclusively on memory to keep track of dates, meetings, and important tasks. However, when someone enters a reminder into the app, they effectively offload a part of their memory onto an external device, allowing them to only require remembering to have their phone with them, reserving internal cognitive load for other things. When the time comes and the phone alerts the individual by triggering a notification, it works similarly to the memory recall process in the brain. In this way, the smartphone becomes an active participant in the cognitive processes of memory and recall, functioning as a part of the mind.</p> <p>I would take this argument a step further to say that <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> tools also function as a part of the mind. Professors may argue that, by using AI tools (like ChatGPT) to write essays, students are simply being lazy and aren’t really doing the work. In reality, this argument is rooted in societal tradition and these tools function to achieve the same outcomes that writing an essay in the traditional sense does. While a student may be less likely to comprehend the information within their internal mind, if one uses the lens of active externalism, the AI tool is a part of the student’s mind. The AI tool simply allows the student to offload internal cognition to the computer, reserving internal cognitive processes for other tasks. (There is much more to say about this, but that is outside the scope of this paper.)</p> <p>I would also argue that one’s mind not only extends beyond their own brain, but into the brains of others. For example, consider the role of the professor, and that of other students, in a learning environment. Here, cognition is a <strong>collaborative and social process</strong>. Using the lens of internalism, one would be forced to argue that the cognitive process of understanding is a process isolated within one’s physical brain. On the contrary, learning and understanding are often facilitated through interactions with others. When students engage in group discussions, projects, or study groups, they are essentially participating in distributed cognitive work. Each student brings their unique understanding, knowledge, and skills to the group. Through discussion and collaboration, these individual contributions are pooled together, leading to a richer and more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter than what any one student could achieve alone. For example, during a group discussion, one student may contribute key facts, another student may offer an insightful interpretation of these facts, and a third may draw connections to other relevant ideas. This collaborative process extends the cognitive capabilities of each individual, allowing them to achieve a level of understanding that transcends their individual capacities. Educators also play a crucial role in the cognitive processes of their students by facilitating learning. They provide support, guidance, and structure to the cognitive processes of students in order to help them learn more effectively. For example, an educator might break down a concept into more manageable parts, provide examples and analogies, ask guiding questions, or offer feedback that helps students refine their cognition. This enables students to engage with and understand concepts that might be beyond their immediate grasp if they were working independently.</p> <p>Active externalism can also be applied to the field of <strong>medicine</strong>, offering a fascinating perspective on the role of the physician. In medical practice, diagnostic tools like CT scanners and MRI machines serve as a part of a physician’s mind. These tools provide critical information that goes beyond the natural perceptual abilities of humans. They can reveal detailed internal structures of the body that are not visible to the naked eye, aiding in the diagnosis of conditions that would otherwise be inaccessible to a doctor’s cognition. In this way, CT’s and MRI’s serve as an extension of vision, allowing clinicians to “see” outside of the visible color spectrum and into the realms of high-energy x-ray wavelengths and detailed magnetic field variations, respectively. Moreover, these scans allow for a deeper cognitive understanding of the patient’s condition, and physicians can integrate this data with other knowledge to enable more accurate diagnoses and treatments. Essentially, these imaging technologies not only extend the physician’s perceptual capabilities but also augment their cognitive processes.</p> <p>In the same way that apps on the smartphone extend memory, <strong>electronic health records (EHRs)</strong> can also extend the memory and capabilities of healthcare professionals. They can provide a comprehensive and accessible repository of patient information including medical history, test results, and treatment information. EHRs allow providers to access vast amounts of data that would be impossible to retain in their internal memory, allowing their internal cognitive load to be focused on integrating the information, rather than memorizing it. The same reasoning can be applied to medical and scientific literature, online databases, and online forums, all of which act as external cognitive resources. These resources greatly extend the physician’s knowledge base beyond what any single individual could hope to memorize or comprehend on their own.</p> <h3>Strengths</h3> <p>Active externalism aligns well with the concept of <strong>haptic realism</strong>, proposed by Mazviita Chirimuuta. Haptic realism emphasizes the importance of interaction, physical contact, and purposeful exploration of the natural world in the process of perception. Chirimuuta argues that, just as touch requires contact and exploration to understand the external world, scientific thought informs us about the natural world through interactive qualities. She contrasts haptic realism with vision science, arguing that science should not rely on a passive reception of information, but an active, exploratory process that involves interaction with the environment. This idea of haptic realism aligns quite well with active externalism. Just as haptic realism emphasizes interaction and exploration in perception, active externalism emphasizes the use of external devices and technologies in cognition. These two ideas have a shared emphasis on interaction and integration with the external world as essential. Just as haptic realism asserts that touch and physical interaction are crucial for a deeper understanding of the world in science, active externalism suggests that external tools and technologies are not mere adjuncts to cognition but are integral components of it. Both of these perspectives challenge the traditional notion of passive reception in cognition and perception, suggesting a dynamic interplay between the individual and external world. In essence, both haptic realism and active externalism suggest a more expansive definition of cognition and understanding, one that transcends the boundaries of the human body and embraces the transformative potential of our interactions with the external environment.</p> <p>Active externalism also fits well with <strong>Eduardo Viveiros de Castro’s Amerindian Perspectivism</strong>. De Castro defines “nature” as what differentiates beings, “culture” as the universal aspect of different beings, and “supernatural” as the existence of beings beyond their natural form. Just as active externalism extends cognition beyond the realm of immediate sensory experiences, Amerindian supernaturalism presents a realm of individuality that goes beyond ordinary experiences, encompassing spiritual or mystical aspects of reality. In the context of Amerindian perspectivism, an individual’s internal cognition can be considered akin to “nature” or “culture” (or a blend of both). In this context, the supernatural could be paralleled with the extended cognitive realms that active externalism explores, where cognition is not just a product of the brain’s internal workings but is dynamically shaped by interactions with the external environment. Thus, both active externalism and Amerindian perspectivism challenge traditional views, suggesting an expanded understanding of cognition and perception. This reshapes how we might understand the mind not as an isolated entity, but as something deeply connected with, and responsive to, the broader environment.</p> <p>The idea of active externalism also pairs nicely with <strong>Ellen Clarke’s notion of biological individuality</strong>. Clarke argues that traditional views of biological individuality, often based on physical or genetic boundaries, may be inadequate or overly simplistic. She emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive approach to defining individuality, one that accounts for the complex and interconnected nature of life forms. Both Clarke’s notion of biological individuality and the concept of active externalism emphasize the importance of considering broader, interconnected systems, rather than restricting the focus to individual, isolated units. Both concepts highlight the emergent properties and capabilities that arise from interconnectedness, whether in biological networks, like a thriving ecosystem, or in collective minds, like a learning environment.</p> <h3>Weaknesses</h3> <p>While active externalism offers a compelling redefinition of cognition, it does have limitations, especially when considering its practical implications in our present society. Traditional societal views often delineate the mind and environment, which is likely rooted in longstanding tradition that privileges internal, individual cognition over external, distributed processes. Embracing active externalism on a wider level may be difficult due to deeply entrenched beliefs in the sanctity and exclusivity of the human mind. There may be skepticism towards active externalism fueled by a cultural and educational system that emphasizes individual achievement over collaboration. Further, this idea may be unsettling for some as it blurs the lines between self and non-self, but it is important to recognize that this theory does not dismiss the individual, but rather expands on what it is to be an individual.</p> <p>Overall, I believe that weaknesses attributed to active externalism are not inherent flaws in the theory itself but are reflections of our societal and cultural inclinations towards internalism. To fully appreciate the potential of active externalism, a paradigm shift in our understanding of cognition, which recognizes the integration of the mind, body, and environment in the cognitive process, is required.</p> <h3>References</h3> <p>Clark, A., & Chalmers, D.

    "contents": "<p>A reflection on <a href='https://philarchive.org/archive/FODSSO' target='_blank'><strong>J.A. Fodor's <i>Special Sciences</i></strong></a>:</p>  <p>In the paper, <i>Special Sciences</i>, J.A. Fodor argues that <strong>reductivism</strong> is too strong a constraint on the unity of science. He argues in favor of the weaker <strong>token physicalism</strong>, which preserves the desired consequences of reductivism while allowing for the unity of science.</p>  <p><strong>Reductivism</strong> (also known as <strong>reductionism</strong>) in science is the view that all special sciences (i.e. all sciences except physics) can be reduced to physics. That is, any event in the special sciences can be adequately explained by a physical event. It is often assumed, for example, that psychology can be reduced to physics via neurology, biology, biochemistry, and chemistry. Psychological events can be explained in terms of neurology, neurological events can be explained in terms of biology, and so on, all the way to physics. In reductivism, concepts from special sciences can be reduced in this manner via <strong>bridge laws</strong>, which are meant to express “identities.” For instance, consider x behavior (a psychological concept) and y pattern of neuronal activation in the brain (a neurological concept). In reductivism, a bridge law (written ‘x ↔ y’) would imply that x behavior is always and only caused by y pattern of neuronal activation, and that y pattern of neuronal activation always and only causes x behavior. This type of relation is known as a <strong>type-to-type correlation</strong>, a 1-to-1 match.</p>  <p><strong>Token physicalism</strong> in science is the view that all events that all sciences talk about are physical events. This interpretation is weaker than reductivism in that reductivism requires type-to-type correlation, whereas token physicalism does not. Consider the previous example of x behavior and y pattern of neuronal activation. In token physicalism, there does not need to exist the 1-to-1 match as was required in reductivism. Instead, for example, x behavior may be caused by a, b, or c patterns of neuronal activation, whether between individuals or within one. In our special sciences, there does not always exist a 1-to-1 match, especially in fields like psychology. The same behavior, emotion, or thought may result from a variety of different situations, each with a distinct pattern of neuronal activation. In such cases, the psychological concept can be explained in terms of neurology, but its entire essence (e.g. the emotion of happiness) cannot be captured with neurology alone. Along the same lines, Fodor mentions that economics cannot be reduced to physics, but that a wide range of physical phenomena could account for economic events. He explains that this provides support for token physicalism, rather than reductivism. In order to prove reductivism, rather than mere token physicalism, one would need to map all of the neuronal firing patterns or physical events to their corresponding psychological or economic events. However, even if this were possible, again, the entire essence of the psychological phenomenon would not be adequately captured.</p>  <p>Fodor mentions that there are two main reasons to believe that token physicalism is a more accurate representation of science than reductivism. First, token physicalism recognizes the inherent complexities and nuances present in the special sciences by allowing exceptions in the laws governing them. He argues that if one were to take the strict reductionist stance, it is challenging to account for minute physical deviations in the context of fields like psychology or economics. Second, the very existence of special sciences is a testament to their unique contributions to understanding the natural world. If everything could truly be reduced to physics, there would be no need for any of the special sciences, including psychology and economics. Ultimately, these fields offer explanations for the manifestations of a myriad of distinct physical events, and they exist because they offer insights that could not be fully appreciated in the context of physics. He continues by arguing that even if fields like psychology or economics could be reduced to mere physics, it is unlikely that the language of physics would be able to concisely account for observations in those fields.</p>  <p>Overall, Fodor prefers the weakest view, <strong>token physicalism</strong>, and argues that reductionists should really be token physicalists. He contends that a strict adherence to reductivism limits our understanding of reality, as it fails to account for the complexities inherent in the special sciences. While physics may lay the foundation for scientific inquiry, it is through the special sciences that we gain a fuller, more nuanced understanding of the natural world.</p>  <p>However, I am inclined toward a broader perspective that synthesizes <strong>Kant’s transcendental realism</strong> with <strong>Christian thought</strong>. Kant’s transcendental realism acknowledges that while we experience reality through the structures of our perception and cognition, there exists a noumenal realm beyond empirical observation—a realm that reductionism cannot fully capture. This perspective aligns with Christianity’s affirmation of a reality that transcends the physical, recognizing the existence of both material and spiritual dimensions.</p>  <p>An example that illustrates the limitations of both reductivism and token physicalism can be found in the study of <strong>human consciousness</strong>. While neuroscience can identify neural correlates of thought, emotion, and self-awareness, it cannot fully explain the subjective experience of being (i.e., <i>qualia</i>). Token physicalism acknowledges the complexity of these experiences by allowing for multiple neurological pathways to correspond with a given mental state, but it does not address why subjective experience exists at all. Kantian transcendentalism provides a richer framework by suggesting that consciousness itself is not just an emergent property of neural activity but a fundamental condition of knowledge, shaping how we interpret reality. Christianity further deepens this perspective by asserting that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of material processes but a reflection of the divine, rooted in the soul’s relationship with God. Together, these perspectives suggest that human experience cannot be fully understood through physical explanations alone; rather, it requires recognition of both the structures of human cognition and the existence of a transcendent order that imbues life with meaning and purpose. By integrating these perspectives, I argue that a truly comprehensive understanding of the world must go beyond token physicalism and incorporate not only the insights of the special sciences but also the recognition of transcendental and divine realities that give meaning to human experience.</p>",

    "contents": "<p><strong>An opinion on <a href='https://www.jstor.org/stable/24356006' target='_blank'><i>Tom Walker’s <i>Who Do We Treat First When Resources Are Scarce?</i></i></a></strong></p>\n\n<p>In this paper, Tom Walker explains that healthcare resources are limited, and difficult decisions must be made about who should receive treatment first. A common intuition suggests that we should prioritize those whose illnesses are not self-inflicted. However, Walker argues that if resources are sufficient, everyone should receive care, and his aim is to construct a principle for determining priority when resources are scarce. Initially, he presents a principle stating that if two people require the same resource, but only one is ill due to their own choices—assuming they had reasonable knowledge of the risks and did not take steps to mitigate them—then the other person should be treated first.</p>\n\n<p>However, this principle raises several ethical concerns. It does not account for whether the choice was truly voluntary, whether the individual had full autonomy, or whether they were in a position to fully understand the risks. Walker attempts to refine this principle by introducing the requirement that the person could have reasonably foreseen the consequences of their actions. Yet, even this revision does not fully resolve the issue, as it does not consider whether the individual had viable alternatives. Walker does present a final principle that further specifies that the person must have had reasonable alternatives and could have recognized a safer course of action. Even so, the principle remains problematic in its application. For example, firefighters who knowingly risk their lives in the line of duty could be deprioritized under such a framework, despite the fact that their actions are widely recognized as selfless and honorable. This suggests that the criteria for determining responsibility in healthcare decisions are far more complex than a simple distinction between voluntary and involuntary harm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fundamentally, I disagree with any framework that attempts to base medical treatment on judgments about whether a person’s illness is self-inflicted.</strong> First, from a practical standpoint, it is exceedingly difficult to determine the degree to which an individual is responsible for their condition. Many diseases and injuries involve complex interactions of genetic, environmental, and social factors, making personal responsibility a murky and often unfair criterion. Second, such a principle risks introducing moral judgments into medical practice, which could lead to a culture of blame and punishment—precisely the opposite of the compassionate, impartial care that medicine should provide. Biases, both conscious and unconscious, could further distort these decisions, leading to inequitable treatment. Moreover, mental health considerations must not be overlooked: many supposedly “self-inflicted” conditions, such as substance use disorders or complications from risky behaviors, are often driven by psychological, social, and economic factors that diminish true autonomy. A system that denies care based on perceived responsibility risks deepening existing disparities and further marginalizing vulnerable populations.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, while Walker’s attempt to establish a rational framework is understandable, it fails to account for the deeper moral imperative of medicine: to care for all people with dignity, irrespective of the circumstances that led to their suffering. In triage situations, the primary considerations should be medical urgency and the ability to benefit from treatment, not subjective judgments of merit. If two patients are equally in need, choosing the one closest or using random selection ensures fairness while upholding the fundamental principle that all human lives are of equal worth. Healthcare should not be seen as a privilege reserved for those deemed \"deserving\" based on past choices but as a basic human right, reflective of the intrinsic dignity of every individual.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>So God created mankind in his own image,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the image of God he created them;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;male and female he created them.</p><p>— Genesis 1:27 (NIV)</p></blockquote>",

    "contents": "<p><strong>In Christian moral reasoning, one may never intentionally do evil, even for the sake of achieving a good outcome.</strong> This distinction between intention and consequence lies at the heart of the Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE), a moral framework that seeks to navigate situations where a single action has both positive and negative consequences. The DDE does not offer a license to commit evil for the sake of good, but rather a structured means of discerning whether an action that results in harm can still be morally permissible—provided the harm is neither the agent’s goal nor the means to that goal.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Why not say—as some slanderously claim that we say—“Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is just!</p><p>— Romans 3:8 (NIV)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>St. Thomas Aquinas offers the clearest foundation for this doctrine when he argues that it is legitimate to preserve one’s own life, even if doing so unintentionally results in the death of an aggressor. For Aquinas, the moral weight of the act depends not on the outcome alone, but on the agent’s intention and the proportionality between means and ends. This theological insight—that a single act may be morally permissible if the evil effect is neither intended nor the cause of the good effect—forms the basis of what later came to be known as the Doctrine of Double Effect.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Nothing hinders one act from having two effects, only one of which is intended, while the other is beside the <a href='intention' target='_blank'>intention</a>, since this is <a href='' target='_blank'>accidental</a> as explained above. Accordingly the act of self-defense may have two effects, one is the saving of one's life, the other is the slaying of the aggressor. Therefore this act, since one's <a href='intention' target='_blank'>intention</a> is to save one's own life, is not unlawful, seeing that it is natural to everything to keep itself in \"being,\" as far as possible. And yet, though proceeding from a <a href='intention' target='_blank'>good intention</a>, an act may be rendered unlawful, if it be out of proportion to the end.</p><p>— Summa Theologiae II–II, Question 64, Article 7</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Contemporary articulations of the DDE typically outline four conditions for moral permissibility:</p><ol><li>The act itself must be morally good or neutral.</li> <li>The bad effect must not be the means to the good effect.</li> <li>The bad effect may be foreseen but not intended.</li> <li>There must be a proportionately grave reason for permitting the bad effect.</li></ol> These conditions echo Aquinas’ reasoning, while giving it practical structure for modern ethical analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike consequentialist theories, which evaluate actions solely by their outcomes, the DDE is rooted in a moral absolutism that affirms the existence of intrinsic right and wrong. While this framework may appear rigid to some, it protects against the moral relativism that can arise when only outcomes matter. The DDE offers a way to remain faithful to moral principles even when faced with tragic choices—affirming that one must always intend the good, never the evil, and that evil may only be tolerated when it is neither sought nor used as a means.</p>\n\n<p>The DDE is particularly relevant in <strong>medical ethics</strong>, where actions often carry morally weighty consequences. A frequently cited application is the use of high-dose opioids in palliative care. When administered with the primary intent of relieving pain in terminally ill patients, any potential hastening of death is considered a foreseen but unintended effect. This practice is morally permissible under the DDE, as the physician’s goal is not death, but comfort—a goal that aligns both with medical ethics and with Christian compassion. Here, the DDE helps safeguard against both nihilistic fatalism and utilitarian overreach by maintaining a firm boundary between intention and effect.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the DDE resonates with the core principles of biomedical ethics—<strong>beneficence</strong> and <strong>non-maleficence</strong> in particular—as it requires careful moral discernment about potential goods and harms. It aligns with the Christian imperative to do good and avoid evil, while acknowledging the tragic complexities of real-life ethical decisions. By providing a principled yet flexible structure, the DDE helps preserve the integrity of moral action, especially in situations where any choice involves suffering.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the doctrine is not without its challenges. Determining intention is not always clear-cut, and there is always the danger of misusing the DDE to justify morally questionable actions. Its emphasis on subjective intention, if not properly understood, can open the door to rationalization rather than genuine discernment. But even here, the DDE serves not as a loophole, but as a call to deeper moral clarity—a way of holding intention, consequence, and character in balance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ultimately, the Doctrine of Double Effect remains a vital tool in Christian ethics and moral philosophy more broadly.</strong> By drawing a firm line between intending harm and merely permitting it, the DDE provides a way of remaining faithful to Romans 3:8—refusing to do evil that good may come—while also engaging the complexity of real moral life. It reflects both reason and compassion, and in doing so, honors the integrity of the human person and the sanctity of life, even in the most difficult of circumstances.</p>",

    "contents": "<p>A reflection on <a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470510544.ch17' target='_blank'>James Hughes' <i>Buddhist Bioethics</i><strong>: </strong></a></p><p>The discussion of Buddhist bioethics highlights the complexity of ethical traditions that, while distinct from Western frameworks, nonetheless resonate with key moral concerns found in broader philosophical and theological discourse. One of the most striking aspects of Buddhist bioethics is its reliance on a <a href='https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/' target='_blank'><strong>teleological virtue ethics</strong></a>, in which moral reasoning is grounded in the pursuit of enlightenment rather than strict <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontology' target='_blank'><strong>deontological obligations</strong></a> or purely <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism' target='_blank'><strong>consequentialist</strong></a> outcomes. This emphasis on cultivating moral virtue and intentionality is compelling, particularly in the context of medical ethics, where actions often carry both positive and negative consequences. The Buddhist notion that morality is grounded in a natural law of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma#In_Buddhism' target='_blank'><strong>karmic causality</strong></a> offers an intriguing parallel to Christian ethical teachings, which emphasize a moral order inscribed into creation.</p>\n\n<p>A key area of overlap between Buddhist and Christian ethics is the centrality of <strong>compassion</strong>. In Buddhist thought, the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva' target='_blank'><strong>bodhisattva</strong></a> embodies selfless compassion, dedicating themselves to alleviating suffering through skillful means. This idea resonates with the Christian ethic of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape' target='_blank'><strong>agape</strong></a>, or self-giving love, which is foundational to Christian moral reasoning. The Christian commitment to healing and care for the sick, as seen in the works of Jesus and the ethical teachings of the Church, closely aligns with Buddhist principles of non-maleficence and beneficence.</p>\n\n<p>However, the two traditions diverge in their conceptions of self. Christianity holds that human beings are created in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_of_God' target='_blank'><strong>the image of God</strong></a>, endowed with an intrinsic dignity that remains constant, whereas Buddhist ethics is shaped by the doctrine of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatt%C4%81' target='_blank'><strong>anattā</strong></a> (no-self), which suggests that personal identity is an illusion. This divergence between Buddhist and Christian ethics emerges in discussions of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. Buddhism’s emphasis on the transitory nature of existence and its rejection of attachment to the physical body sometimes leads to a more permissive stance. By contrast, Christian ethics upholds the intrinsic value of each person’s life, regardless of suffering, and insists that true compassion lies not in hastening death but in accompanying the dying with care and dignity.</p><blockquote><p>So God created mankind in his own image,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the image of God he created them;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;male and female he created them.</p><p>— Genesis 1:27 (NIV)</p></blockquote><p>Another key area of consideration is healthcare access and justice. The Buddhist perspective, as discussed in the text, tends to emphasize compassion and care for the poor, yet it does not provide a clear doctrinal basis for the practice. In contrast, Christian ethics strongly affirms that healthcare is a fundamental human right, as the belief that all human beings are created in God’s image compels an ethical commitment to justice and the preferential option for the poor. As seen in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan' target='_blank'><strong>the parable of the Good Samaritan</strong></a>, Christian teachings emphasize the moral duty to care for the most vulnerable, advocating for healthcare systems that prioritize need rather than ability to pay. Either way, both Buddhist and Christian perspectives contrast with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer-driven_healthcare' target='_blank'><strong>market-driven healthcare models</strong></a> that allocate resources based on wealth rather than moral urgency.</p><blockquote><p> Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead … a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.  He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.’ … Go and do likewise.”</p><p>— Luke 10:30,33-35,37 (NIV)</p></blockquote><p>Despite their differences, Buddhist and Christian ethics share an appreciation for moral intentionality, compassion, and the rejection of purely utilitarian calculations. Both traditions recognize that ethical decision-making cannot be reduced to rigid rules alone but must account for the complexities of human suffering and the call to alleviate it. While each tradition has its own foundational principles, both contribute to a broader understanding of what it means to act ethically in the face of difficult choices, making them invaluable for anyone seeking to navigate the complexities of bioethical reasoning with intellectual depth and moral clarity.</p>",
